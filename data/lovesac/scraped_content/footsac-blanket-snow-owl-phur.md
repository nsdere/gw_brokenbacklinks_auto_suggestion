Incredible luxury
This is the best blanket ever. I received this for Christmas 2020 and I have used it daily ever since. Its texture is amazingly soft and luxurious. The foot pockets keep your feet warm and ensure you won't have a foot sticking out if the blanket shifts as you move around. The Footsac is pricey but it is perfect so its worth it!

Very comfortable, wash/dry with caution
Purchased this blanket for my husband and he loves it (so do I). This is our second Footsac blanket. A word of caution - be very careful when washing/drying this blanket and follow the instructions. Our first blanket was accidentally dried on medium heat and, unfortunately, did not retain its super soft and smooth texture.

Cuddle Up
The big one lovesac is a hit in my family. Every visitor wants to jump in. The ability to sleep while cuddling is magical. Every household should have one. Don’t call it a bean bag! It’s way more than that!

Stunning blanket!

This is our third footsac, and my favorite this far. The snow owl fur is beautiful, and it is silky soft to the touch. As with most footsacs, they are the warmest blankets in our home. I’m very happy with this purchase!
