- **AF** 6/6/24: Fantastic. We have two of the tables to use on our floating ottomans when we want them to function more as a coffee table. They fit perfectly and look beautiful.
  
- **Carnielsen** 11/5/23: Love it! I love having a table on our ottoman. It is perfect for setting things on while sitting.
  
- **El** 11/4/23: Lovesac for life! The longer I have my sactional, the more I love it! I purchased 4 seats/5 sides, standard cushions, in sapphire navy corded velvet. After my delivery, I decided I wanted all deep seats, so exchanged the middle section for a deep side. Customer service was amazing. I fall asleep on my Lovesac several times a week! I’m adding a seat for additional ottoman, as well as the table and some cup holders.
  
- **Thomas R.** 5/3/23: Very versatile and almost a must have! We use it as a coffee table.
  
- **Valerie G.** 2/17/23: Love the New Color - Weathered Ash. These tables are a nice, high quality wood. We’ve been using them for a few months and they’ve withstood the abuse of young toddlers.
  
- **Christine K.** 1/15/23: I really love my sactionals weathered ash table. I use it for my beverages, placing my plates on it, or just displaying a book. It's very easy to clean and looks great.
  
- **Dan** 8/28/22: Comfy work desk. This is great I can sit on my couch and work at the same time!
  
- **Opinion** 6/26/23: It's a table. I wish it had only one arm so you could put it either direction on the cushion. Other than that, it works.
  
- **LP** 8/29/23: Fit - Yes, Quality - Shrug. The table is already scratching and has some chips in the finish.

**Conclusion**

It serves the purpose of having a table on the sofa for drinks and other items, but the quality is not great. We just got ours at Christmas 2022 and it already has chips in the finish.
