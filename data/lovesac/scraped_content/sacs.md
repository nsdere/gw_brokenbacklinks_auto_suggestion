New Cover, looks like a new Sac!
This was a replacement cover. The first one was perfect, just wanted a color & texture change. Washable, looks great!

Love the new PillowSac Accent Chair!!!
We’ve had our PillowSac for 6 months and love it and we just received the accent chair we ordered! My 10 year old and I put it together, it was so easy!  The packaging was perfectly created for ease of assembly and to keep everything in great shape during shipping. The accent chair will keep our PillowSac in place and usable for everyone in the house. With the kids, it ended up all over the living room. It’s so comfy and cozy!! We love it!!

Comfy and Warm
My family bought The Big One for Christmas, and it was huge! Hence the name. It was super soft and I was actually able to sleep in it, which is saying something since I’m sensitive about where I sleep. Something to know however is the more you use it, the smaller it gets, probably the foam condensing or something. You also should flip it every so often so the foam doesn’t clump too much. It’s difficult with the big one, it makes my fingers hurt. I recommend the Big One, but if you don’t want a giant one, then get the CitySac or MovieSac.

Worth it
This thing hugs me like my parents never did. Also roomy enough for my dog to chill with me. Definitely worth it.
