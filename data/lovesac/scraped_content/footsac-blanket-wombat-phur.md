- **Rick Rush (Verified Buyer) 2/1/24:** "Love my Footsac blanket. It's expensive but it by far the softest and most comfortable blanket I have ever had."

- **Bennie 12/30/23:** "Footsac Heaven. Santa left me the footsac under the tree this year. Must say this is the coziest and most luxurious blanket I've ever felt! I can't say for sure it's a de-stresser, but I sure feel warm and relaxed!!"

- **Pseudolyn 12/28/22:** "Best gift! I absolutely love, love, love my new blanket. My pup also loves it. I seriously want to buy one for every person that I remotely like."

- **Sheana T. 9/4/22:** "So very soft and plush. I want to wrap my entire life in wombat fur."

- **Jeremy M. 5/21/21:** "Great blanket! This is a fantastic product and my wife and I frequently snuggle under it while watching a movie late at night! It feels very soft and luxurious to the touch. So far it has held up well, and feels like it will continue to do so. We use the foot pocket once in a while and it is useful for colder nights, though we donâ€™t use it all the time."
