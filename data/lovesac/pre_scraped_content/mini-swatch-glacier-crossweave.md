So many possibilities
We love how many setup options our lovesac gives us. We've probably changed our configuration 5 times so far.
After doing a lot of research (mostly consisting of reading the reviews on the lovesac & costco websites), we decided to go with a deep configuration and love, love, love it.
Also, prior to ordering the actual couch, we ordered a few swatches. We really wanted the ultra velvet, but it would add basically the price of a whole 'nother couch to the total. So we went with the glacial crossweave and are very happy. It's not as soft, but it seems durable and comfortable. We haven't tried washing it yet, but it seems like it would stand up well in the machine.
We watched the videos on youtube about setup which was helpful. Still, it took a whole afternoon and early evening to get all 6 pieces set up and in place.
The whole thing is pretty darn comfortable. Not sink in and never be able to get out comfortable, but maybe when I'm rich I'll get the down fill version ;-P.

great family couch
So comfy!!!, came super fast and it was more work putting together, it was not hard, just more than I was thinking i guess, but love it.
We can all sit on it so comfy!

Go deep
I ended up switching half my sofa out for deep configuration which was super easy to do the lady on the phone was awesome. I will say applying the covers to the sides was very difficult I ended up with blisters on my hands. I also broke my toe when one of the bases tipped over onto it- let’s just say assembly isn’t fun but I love the overall look and feel of this sofa. It’s easy to clean by taking covers off and washing them :) I have two dogs so this is a necessity.

Love the Sactional, Avoid the Crossweave!
We received our 6 seat 8 side sactional back in April and chose the glacier crossweave fabric. We love the sactional. Easy to configure and very comfortable.
BUT, we are very unhappy with the fabric. It began to pill almost immediately on certain cushions. And was especially bad on those that had the most use. Three months in and our soft crossweave is now like sandpaper. Definitely would not recommend this fabric for anyone that has kids or pets or plans to have it in a room with heavy use. Very disappointing for as expensive as these covers are. So definitely go for the sactional, but choose one of their older fabrics that has been tested and reviewed more often to uphold to wear and tear.
