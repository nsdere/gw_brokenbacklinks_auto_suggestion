My mom loves this!

I already owned two non-radiant foot sacs in phur that keep my wife and I nice and toasty. So when I was looking for a gift this last Christmas for my mom this was the first thing that came to mind. The normal phur foot sacs are already very warm and have a nice weight on their own, but this thing takes that to eleven! Perfect for the cold winters in Illinois. My mom loves her present and says she uses it daily. A good purchase all around.

Forgot about the price after getting in

My wife and I get cold feet in ohio winters. Sometimes we have to use a heating pad to take the chill off. We got our radiant footsacs today (yes we ordered 2) and let me say these are the bomb. So cozy and warm. No cold feet! The only concern was the heating elements. We had inquired about how and where the elements were installed and one rep said the footsac area only. This is untrue. The elements run all the way up to your waist. Your feet and legs are warmed by this fabulous blanket. 6 temperature settings are more than sufficient. Started on 6(high) and worked my way down to 1(low). So far for the first day we are very satisfied. Anxiously awaited for their arrival 7 days by fedex.

Great quality blanket

The blanket itself is wonderful. The heat is evenly spread throughout and with the winter months here, life will be nice and toasty. Myself and my partner each have one, along with one we got for each of our mothers. I give 4 stars because one of the ones we gifted had unfortunately had the cord chewed up. In hopes to just replace the cord as the blankets are quite expensive, I reached out and come to find out, you currently cannot buy just a cord replacement. I’m really hoping this comment finds the team and they offer a cord replacement in the future. Though the blanket is great quality and worth the money (even without the heat function), it’s a luxury for most people to buy such a expensive blanket, never mind buying a whole new one if we want the heat back.

Nice blanket but needs some improvements

For the most part, I love this blanket! It is warm and comfortable. I also like the footsac portion more than I thought I would. However, there are a few things they should consider fixing. 1. The heat distribution is pretty good. However, there seems to be about 6 inches around the feet that doesn’t get heated. As a result, if my feet slide too far over, I will feel the cold. 2. Maybe just my opinion but the controller of the blanket was installed upside down. Meaning, the bottom of the controller is orientated towards the bottom of the blanket. So I have to flip the remote upside down when using it with my left hand. 3. I sometimes notice that I have to stretch my hand a bit in order to use the controller. I wish the cord from the foot of the blanket was about 8 inches longer ( I am 6 foot). 4. One last improvement might be adding a small hook on the side of the blanket so that you can keep the controller in a locked position. I sometimes have to search for the remote because it moves freely. Overall, I think this blanket great but would love it even more if it has those tweaks.

Heating stopped working after a few uses

Super beautiful soft blanket. My poor review is because the heating stopped working after only a handful of uses. :( there is no damage to the cord, the blanket had never been washed or around water either.

Super bummed.
