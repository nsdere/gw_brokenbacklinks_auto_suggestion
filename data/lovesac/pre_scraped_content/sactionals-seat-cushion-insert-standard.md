Awesome Customizable High Quality Furniture
We love the forethought and versatility designed into the Lovesactional. It is constructed very well and will last for many years. There are many options to upgrade the seating experience and we chose upgrades that make it sublime. Customer service has been excellent to answer questions and shipping was fast and within the quoted time to meet expectations.

Best couch ever
We have had our love sac for almost 5 years and absolutely love it. All our guests love it and always ask about it.

Great during WFH
I bought a new set of Standard cushions at the beginning of the WFH order about 2 years ago, the firmness at first was concerning but after sitting on them for 2 years and they are worn in and comphy cozy. I would buy them again.

Other to reviewers are crazy
I'll leave another review once I've owned mine for a period of time but people complaining about the standard fill being too hard are absolutely out of their mind... It has just the right amount of give I can't imagine wanting a softer squishier seat for that you would just buy an actual lovesac style bean bag

Love the design, durabilty is the question
Love the design, durabilty is the question. After two weeks of daily use, the seat cushions are noticeably weaker. If they continue to soften at this rate I will need a replacement set after one to two months. For more conext, I am the heaviest of our family of four weighing in at 155 lbs.

Cushions too hard
This couch is too hard and uncomfortable. I wish that I had bought the softer seat cushions....and it's expensive to consider replacing the ones that I have. I don't think that I will buy another Lovesac unfortunately. I really love the idea of them....

Cushions don't last
The design/idea of this couch is great, however the cushions don't last. If you use this couch for everyday use, the cushions will become VERY uncomfortable/flat VERY quickly. For the price you would think it would last longer than a couple years but it just doesn't.
