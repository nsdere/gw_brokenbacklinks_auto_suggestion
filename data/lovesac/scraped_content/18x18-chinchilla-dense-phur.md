Durable, absorbs moisture & Easy to clean!

I use my squattoman in the bathroom and sometimes I also put it next to my supersac in the living room. It’s super easy to move from more room to room because it’s really light and the material absorbs moisture really well I once let the bathroom tub to overflow and I was able to easily unzip the cover and let it dry with a ceiling fan it was completely fine and the insert was able to dry really quickly as well.

Beautiful Pillow

I love this pillow, great craftsmanship with piping around the edge. Great combination of colors. It took a while to arrive, but it was worth the wait.

What’s not to love?

Love love LUV our squattomans! We have three and use them most of every day, since we’re retired. Soft, washable, and easy to move around.
