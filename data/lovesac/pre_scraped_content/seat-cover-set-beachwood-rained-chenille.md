Love it!
We love this couch! The fabric so is beautiful and soft. Customer service was beyond amazing! We ended up changing the filling type after delivery and couldn't be happier with everyone involved that helped us get what we wanted. Thank you!

Great fabric, stuffing, wish the back support was higher
Love the fabric. Very soft, love soft filling. Have washed off several spots from the fabric but haven't completely washed in washing machine. Husband doesn't feel there is enough back support bc it is so low. Kids love jumping on it. Really love the modular pattern

Love the versatile of the seating but not really comfortable

Not as good as I hoped
The showroom made the couch seem much more comfortable and stylish than it is. Itâ€™s almost impossible to get all the stitching lined up on the cushion so it looks very messy. We also have large gaps between each piece. Regretting purchasing such an expensive piece of furniture
