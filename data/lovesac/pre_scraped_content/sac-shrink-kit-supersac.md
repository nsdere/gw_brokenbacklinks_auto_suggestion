MOVING MUST NEED!
There’s no way I would’ve been able to move my giant sac without this gem. I would recommend 100%

Thank you!
Worked great! Helped us move our giant love sac across the country. It doesnt make it the perfect shape but made it small enough to fit in the bag and easier to m9ve/keep clean/store.
Also, customer service was great. When we realized it wouldn't be here in time they helped expedite our shrink kit.

Sac Shrink Kit Works
The Kit took a good while to arrive so I am glad I ordered it when I did. I asked a friend to come over to help me shrink the SuperSac. The best part was watching the How To video on YouTube. Bravo to the 2 guys that did that. We belly laughed our way through the process. We broke a sweat, but dag-gone it, we shrunk that sac and got it contained in the duffle.

It works
It took a lot of work, but it shrank. Definitely need a shop vac, home vacuum like in the website video was a joke.

Great for transportation
Came with giant duffle and several of the giant plastic shrink bags. Definitely takes a heavy duty vacuum/shop vac and a few people shrink a SuperSac into the duffle but overall worked as described.

Love sac shrink kit sucks so good
Made moving the sac so much easier!! Decent quality of bags.

Grateful
We just moved and needed to shrink our lovesac. The YouTube directions/steps were helpful. It took about 25 minutes and made moving easy.

Worked as advertised. You can't
Worked as advertised. You can't pull all the air out with a normal vacuum (even cordless Dysons). You will need to rent a shop vac from home Depot or Lowe's (about 20). Normal vacuums don't have enough suction. Otherwise, the setup is easy.

Well worth the price
I know a lot of reviews mentioned the price was too high and some people didn't seem happy with the product, but I couldn't find anything else to try and moving them any other way seemed crazy, so I went ahead and bought it. Now of course I somehow didn't see that there were different sizes of shrink kits and bought this size even though I have 2 city sacs. The thought was if it worked I would by another one. But as it was the bag was so big, we decided to try it with both sacs in one bag. To make it a bit easier we used a zip tie to hold the bag around the vacuum hose and then we didn't have to hold the house. It worked GREAT. I did not find the bag to be thin at all. seemed sturdy to me. We followed the directions and rolled the sacs over to help shape it in a rectangle shape. our only mistake was that when we put the sacs in the zippered bag, we had the hose near the start of the zipper not the end. but we are just shrinking them for a move and the don't need the shop vac before we move, we just tucked the hose in the bag as we zipped up and when we got to the end detached the hose from the shop bag and finished zipping up the duffle bag. I am sure air will get in but as I said this is just short term to move them to our new house. We did have 3 people but could have done it with two. In hindsight I am glad I didn't know about the different sizes because all shrink kits cost $65 no matter the size. I would have ended up buying 2 if I bought the right size. I do think that the small kits should be less money. But overall, I am not upset with the price I paid.

Works great.
I was worried because of the reviews but I did it by myself while trying to get my 11 month old baby away.
Only thing I suggest is make sure you do turn in to kinda shape it. But that also says it in the instructions!
