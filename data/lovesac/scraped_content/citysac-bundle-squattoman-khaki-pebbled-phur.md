Sac Sacs may look like a beanbag, but they are so much more. The super-soft fill is made of premium shredded Durafoam™ which, unlike bead-filled bags, absorbs body weight evenly and doesn't compress over time. 

The CitySac: 3' x 3'3" 

Footsac: This Footsac blanket does so much more than keep you cozy on the couch (although it does that very well). Along the bottom of the blanket is an 18" pocket for your feet, which means that you will never again struggle to keep your whole body covered. 

Squattoman: The Squattoman footstool is the ultimate Sac sidekick. It's the perfect height to rest your feet on when you're lounging on your Sac and comes in handy as an extra seat when you have guests over. The base upholstery fabric of every Squattoman is made using 12 repurposed plastic water bottles. Squattomans are filled with a premium, proprietary blend of foam and fibers, designed to be supportive and hold their shape over time.
