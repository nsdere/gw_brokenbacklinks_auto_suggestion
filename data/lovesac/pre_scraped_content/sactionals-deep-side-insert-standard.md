Don’t use the online design space
Love the adaptability. The design space online is terrible. We ended up with two random deep portions, the entire thing was supposed to be deep. 8 pieces and 2 are deep.

Deep side insert
We needed another deep insert to expand our current setup. Well worth the purchase!

Love Lovesac!
So easy to add pieces to my sactional. I love the versatility and look of Lovesac. Couldn't be happier!

Did not break in half. Customer service with Lovesac has been exceptional since I got my first Lovesac back in 2008. The covers on this piece are great and there are no cushions

Deep side worth it!
Love having this deep side insert! We didn’t realize it but we really like having deep seats. The entire sactional, is our favorite and we have enjoyed this couch and its extreme comfort! 10/10 worth every penny

Adding this piece gives me so much more flexibility in my setup

Recently switched the seats to deep side in the sactional and to have the back pillows to fit correctly had to order two more deep side pillows with covers. Fits like a glove.
