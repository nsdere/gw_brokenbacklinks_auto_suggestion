Expected better
It took forever on shipping (10 weeks) and part of it was chipped when I got it. Basic accessories should be in stock, not waiting on China to produce and ship it.

Don't get them wet
We had a water leak in the room our love sac was in and water was moving across the floor. It was cleaned up within a few hours but the type of material they are made of sucked in the water and split the veneer. It's quite unsightly and makes my high end couch, look more like a hand me down. Having a hard time justifying buying 6 new ones at this price point.

Need more shoe shapes
we just rearranged our sactional, and the 4 hole shoe is really limiting our options. having a few more shoe shapes for unconventional layouts would make the sactional much more versitle, especially for those with a large number of seats! (we have 10)

Cheap Veneer
The cheap veneer on these shoes makes them hardly worth the price tag. After moving my sactional once to clean under the couch, the veneer dislodged from almost every shoe. Now I have to deal with unsightly base-plates under my couch. Terribly built at an even more terrible price point.
