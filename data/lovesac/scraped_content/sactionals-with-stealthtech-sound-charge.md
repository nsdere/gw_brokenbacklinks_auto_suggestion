Simple, Easy, Best Experience Ever!!!
Our Sactional with StealthTech + Charge arrived six days after purchase, which was exceptional since all 20 boxes were delivered simultaneously. The packaging was excellent, and there was no damage. Sean Nelson recommends opening the boxes from one end, flipping them, and lifting to let the pieces slide out. We found it faster and easier to open one end, flip, open the other end, and slide the box off, avoiding the suction created by sliding out the pieces. Assembling the pieces on our dining room table, using it as a workbench, proved to be much easier and less straining on the back than working on the floor. The assembly was as straightforward as the instructional videos indicated. The covers fitted easily, particularly when working at table height. It took us approximately seven hours (me 70, she 63) to unbox and assemble the entire Sactional with StealthTech. The StealthTech system assembled quickly, and everything paired seamlessly. The Sactionals are solidly built, sturdy, and durable. The chargers operate perfectly. We are confident this will be the last living room furniture we'll ever need. We absolutely love it!

Amazing System!
The product has been absolutely amazing! We did have an issue with the left side speaker. We got back back from vacation and the speaker was comepletely blown and the wireless charging was not working. I contacted customer service on Monday and by Friday I had a replacement on my doorstep! Amazing service! And my system is almost three years old we bought it when it first came out! I highly recommend Lovesac!

Awesome Sound and being hidden is a bonus
We've had our system setup for over a year now and it has been PERFECT. The sound is awesome, our only regret is we didn't get more of the side speakers.

Very happy with out Sactional + StealthTech
Pros:
-Helpful in-store service and post-purchase support
-The product shipped FAST (arrived within 5 days of placing order).  Much better than waiting months for custom furniture.
-The build quality seems solid and the sactional looks great in our space
-The assembly was relatively easy and intuitive once we checked out the YouTube channel and consulted the StealthTech instruction manual (note a couple of caveats below)
-We purchased the “Lovesoft” fill and deep seating and the couch has been comfortable out of the gate.
-We have cats that like to destroy furniture so love the ability to wash the covers, change them around or replace as needed
Cons:
-We were prepared for this, but assembly takes a while (It took two of us 5-6 hours for an L-shaped sactional with StealthTech and accompanying arm chair).  It’s actually kind of fun once you get into it as nothing is too heavy, everything is packed well and there are no tools required.
-Be prepared for tons of boxes and leftover cardboard.  Our porch is currently covered in boxes while we work out how to convoy everything to the recycling depot.
-The StealthTech system sounds great but has a couple of annoying quirks.  It can only pair with one app at a time and firmware updates require downloading to a provided thumb drive. Unlike other reviewers, our subwoofer and satellite speakers have remained reliably paired to the soundbar.
-Wireless charging on the sides has been useless and the corded power hub is difficult to access without removing the bottom cushion.
Aside from the minor quibbles above, we’re delighted with our purchase!

A feature we didn’t know we needed. Love it
An upgrade we didn’t know we needed. We love this feature and how we can watch live concert streams to great movies. We love the bass in the seat and how it makes you feel like you in the movies.

Better than we thought even after testing it in the showroom. We love it so much. Super versatile— takes some practice to get the modes correct but it’s great!

Beyond happy
Ok first off you have to understand I've been looking for a sectional for 7 years.  7! We moved into our new house in 2017 which has a very large but awkward size living room.  I knew we needed a sectional but nothing currently on the market was the right size.  I finally decided to look at Lovesac and it's been perfect.  I created a sectional exactly in the dimensions I needed.  I ended up even being able to add what I thought was going to be an ottoman as another seat so three people can lay at the same time.  I plan to add another seat in the near future.  No other brand would allow me to be able to add on.  It also was perfect as we have a new puppy and a very energetic 9 year old who has already flipped his way onto the couch.  It didn't even move.  I'm confident it will hold up but even if it doesn't i can replace any part I need to without replacing an entire couch.  Well worth my money but I do recommend configuring in store.  It is complicated if you want to have deep versus standard.  Watch the videos, take your time, and the set up ist definitely do able.

Showroom Experience
Not only do I love the sectionals, the StealthTech system gave us that showroom experience. I’ve read about some people having to unplug the system to regain the connection. I have lost it once, but instead of unplugging the system I just went to my Bluetooth list in my IPhone settings. One touch of the StealthTech connection and I was back in business. I highly recommend trying that first.
