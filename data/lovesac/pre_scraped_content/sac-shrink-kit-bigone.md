5 stars, if using ratchet straps
I had 3 adults trying for over an hour to get it to work and just could not make it quite small enough to zip. We tried again later using ratchet straps and got it in about about 10-15 minutes

Love sac bag/holder
Worked as advertised! We were able to use the cheeky video to shrink down the lovesac and it was easy to then move into our vehicle to transport it to our friendâ€™s basement. Nice to have the option to move/store it. Enjoyable video to learn how to use it ;) (our first one did have a broken zipper, but they sent us a new one and all was good).

PERFECT!
Best thing for moving, ever!  Without the bag, it would have been impossible to move from house to house.

Worked Like A Charm
After reading reviews, I had very low expectations of whether or not this would work, but since we are moving cross country, we had to give it a try. I followed the YouTube video showing how to do it and we had no problems at all!. 15 minutes later, our BIG One was in the duffle and ready to load on the moving truck. It took two adults and a 10 year old, but I def recommend at least two adults to pull this off. It will take a minute to realize it is shrinking, but just keep pushing until it is small enough to fit in the duffle. We had plenty of room once we had it shrunk down. Although this did work, it would not be too difficult for LoveSac to add a nozzle on the plastic bag to make the process easier.

Shrink Sac
I am just now shrinking my LoveSac since receiving it last June for Father's Day. The process was so easy I did not need the help of YouTube. No one told us that it would be just as fun shrinking the Big-One LoveSac. The instructions say to sit on the sac while it is shrinking. My husband and I had a ball taking turns.

Makes Moving Easy
While it takes a bit of work to get the shrink kit on and then into the bag, it works great for moving and keeping things protected. Shipping took quite a while though.

Shrink Kit worked great!
The kit did its job and what it was meant to do, which was to shrink the big one and prep it for travel and storage. Very pleased with it!

Easy to Use
Easy to use and sturdy! Lovesac is on its way to get moved to our new house! If only I could get a discount on a new cover!

Shrinking the Big One
Not a one person job, but was able to do it by myself and move it without any problems :sweat_smile:

A little work, but it works
You will want someone to help you, but it works as it is suppose to.
