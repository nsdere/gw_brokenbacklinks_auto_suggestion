So convenient
I bought two of these to go along with out sactional and we really use them. It’s nice because they can go on the seats or on the ottomans. They match our floors so that’s a plus too. They’re sturdy so that means they’re heavy but the quality is there.

Great alternative to a coffee table l!
Love this little table. Allows us to have an ottoman when we need it and a table when we need it without swapping out entire pieces of furniture.

I stow this away behind the sofa while not in use. So easy to take out and put on a cushion! Love it with my sofa

Replaced coffee table
This Sactional Table worked very well for me, placed it near edge of unit and it gave me more room.
