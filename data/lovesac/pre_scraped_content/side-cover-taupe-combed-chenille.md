Love my Lovesac
I love this color as it is neutral and works with cool or warm tones. Color can be added with pillows or throws.

amazing
This couch is super well made! I know it will last forever. The quality is way beyond anything I've seen. Super easy to assemble, thank you for the quick & easy videos!!! The fabric is beautiful & again extremely well made. The couch is absolutely the most comfortable couch I've ever experienced. All made in the USA? Almost too good to be true, but it iss!!!

Really nice fabric and look.
The fabric is of great quality and looks really nice. They fit very tight to the side pieces which is great but also makes it tough to put on. I used rubber gloves to protect my fingers from the Velcro when putting these on. Overall very happy!

It’s really awesome that 2
It’s really awesome that 2 years after my initial purchase of a couch that I can decide to expand the size! Washability is also a game changer with doggo and teenagers. I will say that my covers have shrunk but that’s probably more about my laundry skills.

All good. The only downside
All good. The only downside is getting covers to fit flat. It may take time as these covers are extremely tight fit and, possibly, it may stretch a bit.
