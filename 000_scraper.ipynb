And, when you have a lovesac Sactional, that means time for a new arrangement! Actually, this is our second new rug in the last couple weeks. I still LOVE our old rug (the patterned one in the fourth pic) but I didn’t like it with the color of our new couch. Our first new rug (fifth pic) added lots of texture and was super soft underfoot, but it was wool and shed like crazy!! I knew it would some, but was unprepared for just how much fuzz would be ALL over our house. I couldn’t stand it, so we packaged it back up. We rolled out our second new rug this morning and since this one is synthetic, it shouldn’t shed. Is a light color practical with 2 kids and a dog? No. But it looks good with the couch and our Shoji White walls! It was a good price for a rug this size so while I don’t think we’ll get 10 years out of it like our last one, I’ll be happy with it while it lasts. This is our third layout to test out with the Sactional and it might be my favorite one yet. We tried out a big L-shaped couch to start with, then switched to two love seat couches with one having 2 chaises. And now we have a longer couch and a chair/chaise. Here’s the official review on the lovesac: we don’t like it. We LOVE it!!! It is SO comfortable and soft. If you know me well at all, you know I’m an afternoon napper. This couch does not disappoint - I can be out cold within minutes! 😆 The fabric color is not as dark as I thought it would be, but it has grown on me. It did have a smell when we initially unpacked it, but it’s starting to fade away. We’ve spot cleaned one area but haven’t had to put any of it in the washing machine yet. And we’re getting really good at taking it apart and reassembling it! Hopefully this new rug is a keeper and it can stay in this layout for a while. Don’t judge the rest of the room. I’m shopping for a new coffee table and throw pillows and you can see I’m testing out two different curtain fabrics on the windows.

Subject to credit approval. 24 equal monthly payments required. Visit a Lovesac showroom or see website for more details. †Qualifying purchase amount must be on one receipt. No interest will be charged and equal monthly payments are required on promo purchase until it is paid in full. The payments equal the initial total promo purchase amount divided by the number of months in the promo period, rounded up to the next whole dollar. These payments may be higher than the payments that would be required if this purchase was a non-promo purchase. During the last month(s) of the promo period the required monthly payment may be reduced due to the prior months’ rounding. Any estimated required monthly payments shown in connection with this promotional offer may exclude taxes and delivery and should allow you to pay off the promotional purchase within the promo period if (1) you make your payments by the due date each month and (2) this is the only balance on your account during the promo period. If you have other balances on your account, this monthly payment will be added to the minimum payment applicable to those balances. Regular account terms apply to non-promo purchases. For new accounts: Purchase APR is 29.99%; Minimum Interest Charge is $2. Existing cardholders: See your credit card agreement terms. Subject to credit approval.\n",

      "My family bought The Big One for Christmas, and it was huge! Hence the name. It was super soft and I was actually able to sleep in it, which is saying something since I’m sensitive about where I sleep. Something to know however is the more you use it, the smaller it gets, probably the foam condensing or something. You also should flip it every so often so the foam doesn’t clump too much. It’s difficult with the big one, it makes my fingers hurt. I recommend the Big One, but if you don’t want a giant one, then get the CitySac or MovieSac.\n",

Subject to credit approval. 24 equal monthly payments required. Visit a Lovesac showroom or see website for more details. †Qualifying purchase amount must be on one receipt. No interest will be charged and equal monthly payments are required on promo purchase until it is paid in full. The payments equal the initial total promo purchase amount divided by the number of months in the promo period, rounded up to the next whole dollar. These payments may be higher than the payments that would be required if this purchase was a non-promo purchase. During the last month(s) of the promo period the required monthly payment may be reduced due to the prior months’ rounding. Any estimated required monthly payments shown in connection with this promotional offer may exclude taxes and delivery and should allow you to pay off the promotional purchase within the promo period if (1) you make your payments by the due date each month and (2) this is the only balance on your account during the promo period.

(7) (4) T The First 4/26/24 Fill: Standard Foam Room Size: Large Space Sac Size: The BigOne Fabric: Wombat Phur Features: Comfort Comfy and Warm My family bought The Big One for Christmas, and it was huge! Hence the name. It was super soft and I was actually able to sleep in it, which is saying something since I’m sensitive about where I sleep. Something to know however is the more you use it, the smaller it gets, probably the foam condensing or something. You also should flip it every so often so the foam doesn’t clump too much. It’s difficult with the big one, it makes my fingers hurt. I recommend the Big One, but if you don’t want a giant one, then get the CitySac or MovieSac. Share Was this review helpful?

(7) (4) T The First 4/26/24 Fill: Standard Foam Room Size: Large Space Sac Size: The BigOne Fabric: Wombat Phur Features: Comfort Comfy and Warm My family bought The Big One for Christmas, and it was huge! Hence the name. It was super soft and I was actually able to sleep in it, which is saying something since I’m sensitive about where I sleep. Something to know however is the more you use it, the smaller it gets, probably the foam condensing or something. You also should flip it every so often so the foam doesn’t clump too much. It’s difficult with the big one, it makes my fingers hurt. I recommend the Big One, but if you don’t want a giant one, then get the CitySac or MovieSac. Share Was this review helpful?

      "Comfy and Warm My family bought The Big One for Christmas, and it was huge! Hence the name. It was super soft and I was actually able to sleep in it, which is saying something since I’m sensitive about where I sleep. Something to know however is the more you use it, the smaller it gets, probably the foam condensing or something. You also should flip it every so often so the foam doesn’t clump too much. It’s difficult with the big one, it makes my fingers hurt. I recommend the Big One, but if you don’t want a giant one, then get the CitySac or MovieSac.\n",

      "- **Jeremy M. 5/21/21:** \"Great blanket! This is a fantastic product and my wife and I frequently snuggle under it while watching a movie late at night! It feels very soft and luxurious to the touch. So far it has held up well, and feels like it will continue to do so. We use the foot pocket once in a while and it is useful for colder nights, though we don’t use it all the time.\"\n",

Well i loved it 😔 I've purchased 3 different footsacks. I loved them all...but i guess my ex-wife did too because she literally took every single one in the divorce.

It's a blanket?\\\" I said \\\"thats exactly what she said when i told her the price I paid... Before it was delivered. But obviously it's not 'just as blanket' or she would not have stolen all 3.\\\" I'm dead serious. Check the screen shot. That's from the actual divorce settlement offer. We argued over all three blankets, but this bronze wombat (i purchased the footsack for 2 but same fabric) is on another level. I never did get my blanket back. She argued with me while we were married for purchasing it. And when i purchased 2 more (different fabrics.) that matched other room decor (i have 2 love sacs also. She would've snuck out with those too if she could carry them. I'm sure of it) So, if you buy this, put it in a prenup... trust me. The old joke \\\"why is divorce so expensive?

      "I ordered a Lovesac bundle through Costco and it came with two Hazelwood Phur footsac blankets. The blankets are a great weight for chilly nights and so cozy. Great quality and beautiful. I love the Footsac so much I would even pay full price. The foot part keeps feet so toasty that you don't need socks.\n",

      "- Cathy 9/12/22: Love this! I’ve had my alpine swirl foot sac for at least 7 years and it’s held up really well. So well my husband has taken it, so I am buying him his own as his 2nd anniversary (cotton) gift. It gets washed monthly and is still amazing.\n",
      "- Sam 7/19/22: Amazing. I’m in love with this blanket. I’ve had it for a few years now. It’s held up well throughout all its washes. Ultimate cozy level.\n",
      "- David 6/27/22: Falls apart quickly. The Alpine Phur Swirl (previously named Eskimo Phur Swirl) is a terrible blanket in terms of long-lasting quality. It was great for the initial 4-6 months I used it. But after barely washing it (2 times), the product degraded quickly. The phur microfibers get everywhere. They even ended up in my daughter's eyes and I had to pick them out for her.\n",

I also like the footsac portion more than I thought I would. However, there are a few things they should consider fixing. 1. The heat distribution is pretty good. However, there seems to be about 6 inches around the feet that doesn’t get heated. As a result, if my feet slide too far over, I will feel the cold. 2. Maybe just my opinion but the controller of the blanket was installed upside down. Meaning, the bottom of the controller is orientated towards the bottom of the blanket. So I have to flip the remote upside down when using it with my left hand. 3. I sometimes notice that I have to stretch my hand a bit in order to use the controller. I wish the cord from the foot of the blanket was about 8 inches longer ( I am 6 foot). 4. One last improvement might be adding a small hook on the side of the blanket so that you can keep the controller in a locked position.

Your feet and legs are warmed by this fabulous blanket. 6 temperature settings are more than sufficient. Started on 6(high) and worked my way down to 1(low). So far for the first day we are very satisfied. Anxiously awaited for their arrival 7 days by fedex.\n",

      "The blanket itself is wonderful. The heat is evenly spread throughout and with the winter months here, life will be nice and toasty. Myself and my partner each have one, along with one we got for each of our mothers. I give 4 stars because one of the ones we gifted had unfortunately had the cord chewed up. In hopes to just replace the cord as the blankets are quite expensive, I reached out and come to find out, you currently cannot buy just a cord replacement. I’m really hoping this comment finds the team and they offer a cord replacement in the future. Though the blanket is great quality and worth the money (even without the heat function), it’s a luxury for most people to buy such a expensive blanket, never mind buying a whole new one if we want the heat back.\n",

      "\n",
      "For the most part, I love this blanket! It is warm and comfortable. I also like the footsac portion more than I thought I would. However, there are a few things they should consider fixing. 1. The heat distribution is pretty good. However, there seems to be about 6 inches around the feet that doesn’t get heated. As a result, if my feet slide too far over, I will feel the cold. 2. Maybe just my opinion but the controller of the blanket was installed upside down. Meaning, the bottom of the controller is orientated towards the bottom of the blanket. So I have to flip the remote upside down when using it with my left hand. 3. I sometimes notice that I have to stretch my hand a bit in order to use the controller. I wish the cord from the foot of the blanket was about 8 inches longer ( I am 6 foot). 4. One last improvement might be adding a small hook on the side of the blanket so that you can keep the controller in a locked position. I sometimes have to search for the remote because it moves freely. Overall, I think this blanket great but would love it even more if it has those tweaks.\n",

But after a few weeks I realized we really needed them. I bought 3, and I’m so glad I did. Wow. Has made all the difference. We don’t have a table in the living room, so there was not a place for drinks. These are so perfect. Super sturdy. Heavy. They do not move. Highly recommend.\\n  \\n- **Nell** (Verified Buyer, 4/16/24): Love them nice quality and heavy. They are made very well definitely worth the money.\\n  \\n- **Verified Buyer** (3/31/24): Solidly made! Fits on the arm of Lovesac couch snugly. The depth of holder helps keep glass from tipping over.\\n  \\n- **Verified Buyer** (3/27/24): We decided on the deeper drink holders. Perfect to keep things in place with the kids running around. To store, we just stick them on the back edge of the couch.\\n  \\n- **L A** (Verified Buyer, 3/3/24): We are thoroughly pleased with the purchase of our drink holder. It has been a great addition to our Lovesac sactional. The quality is wonderful, and the size is a perfect fit.\\n  \\n- **Carla G** (Verified Buyer, 2/14/24): Works great and fits multiple sizes of mugs and cups.\\n  \\n- **Naeface** (Verified Buyer, 1/20/24): Great product.

      "- **El** 11/4/23: Lovesac for life! The longer I have my sactional, the more I love it! I purchased 4 seats/5 sides, standard cushions, in sapphire navy corded velvet. After my delivery, I decided I wanted all deep seats, so exchanged the middle section for a deep side. Customer service was amazing. I fall asleep on my Lovesac several times a week! I’m adding a seat for additional ottoman, as well as the table and some cup holders.\n",

      "- **Thomas R.** 5/3/23: Very versatile and almost a must have! We use it as a coffee table.\n",
      "  \n",
      "- **Valerie G.** 2/17/23: Love the New Color - Weathered Ash. These tables are a nice, high quality wood. We’ve been using them for a few months and they’ve withstood the abuse of young toddlers.\n",
      "  \n",
      "- **Christine K.** 1/15/23: I really love my sactionals weathered ash table. I use it for my beverages, placing my plates on it, or just displaying a book. It's very easy to clean and looks great.\n",
      "  \n",
      "- **Dan** 8/28/22: Comfy work desk. This is great I can sit on my couch and work at the same time!\n",
      "  \n",
      "- **Opinion** 6/26/23: It's a table. I wish it had only one arm so you could put it either direction on the cushion. Other than that, it works.\n",
      "  \n",
      "- **LP** 8/29/23: Fit - Yes, Quality - Shrug. The table is already scratching and has some chips in the finish.\n",

      "**Conclusion**\n",
      "\n",
      "It serves the purpose of having a table on the sofa for drinks and other items, but the quality is not great. We just got ours at Christmas 2022 and it already has chips in the finish.\n",
