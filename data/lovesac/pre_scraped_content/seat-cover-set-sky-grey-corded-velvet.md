I purchased to additional sky gray corded velvet seat covers to add onto two new seat inserts for my existing Sactional and the color and quality are perfectly identical (which I found impressive, since my original Sactional is already 4+ years old and has survived two moves, two messy dogs, and two equally messy/clumsy adults).
Don't shy away from these covers just because of the light color--they wash phenomenally and have yet to show signs of wear over the years. Thrilled to know that the new covers matched the 4-year-old ones.

I’ve had these couches for about 4 months. So far the it’s been the best investment. It’s extremely comfortable, it feels soft. I’ve been able to wash it very easily and air dry. Stains come out nicely. Not having to take out my machine to wash couches has been a blessing! I’m very satisfied. Fabric does not seek through! The couches do not sink so easily, definitely quality couches!

I was reluctant of the cost, but this is the best purchase I ever made. Absolutely beautiful in my home and so comfy. I’ve only had to wash a couple seats so far, but it was super easy to take off & wash and looked brand new. We all love it!
