Features: Comfort
Luxurious and Comfy
I ordered a Lovesac bundle through Costco and it came with two Hazelwood Phur footsac blankets. The blankets are a great weight for chilly nights and so cozy. Great quality and beautiful. I love the Footsac so much I would even pay full price. The foot part keeps feet so toasty that you don't need socks.

Long time use
Have had mine since 2018 and have been using it every night since. Been through many machine washes and still is so soft and amazing quality!

My favorite!!
This blanket is my absolute favorite! I have several throw blankets, but this is hands down my #1 go to! So soft, roomy and very warm!
