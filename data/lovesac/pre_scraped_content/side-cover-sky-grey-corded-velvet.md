SkyCorded Velvet LOVE
I absolutely adored this color! It definitely brightens up the room, and I get soooo many compliments! I got this as my second cover set, and it has become my main color!

Great
Love the color, but for me I wish I would have got the charcoal gray. This color is beautiful but it’s too light for me.

Love the neutral color. I
Love the neutral color. I have a cat and dog, both light colored hair, and this cleans up easily. Hair isn’t sticking to it or noticeable at all. I am not afraid to have the pets on the couch. Easy to clean!

Great couch but a few flaws that need improvement
Great couch amazing idea but definitely needs fine tuning the feet don’t always line up with the wood blocks it could be better it’s a tight fit but not great when putting four together. extremely sturdy and comfortable is to clean and keep clean the phone charging system Dora t really charge the phone just overheats it.

Poorly made covers
My husband and I purchased a lovesactional for our basement we finished. We recently (and finally) set up the couch. The couch seems well built, however, the covers are poorly made. There are loose threads every where! Also, some of the corners that meet the bottom of the seats aren't fully stitched/have loose threads, so it appears these won't last long or will tear easily. It is very disappointing considering the price of the covers and sactional are VERY expensive. For the price, I expect next to perfection and no manufacturing errors that will ultimately lead to needing untimely replacement of the covers. These imperfections are on all of my covers...

DO NOT BUY
I wish I never bought this couch. After testing out our friend's couch, we gave it try. What was mailed to us is not the quality my friend has nor what we tested out in store. Didn't even receive our entire order/or items paid for. Significant manufacturer's defects with loose threads and dry rot EVERY WHERE! The covers are not completely stitched and visible on every cushion and especially at the bottom. Stealth overheats and has burned my child's skin (let along all of my expensive electronics that have been burnt due to plug port) -- and don't let your guests mistakenly use the wireless phone chargers -- I owe a friend a new phone from it shorting it. I have tried for almost a year now contacting Lovesac to address my concerns with no response or help. You'd think for the money paid you'd have amazing quality and for the company to stand my their products by RESPONDING to complaints. No one to chat with, no response on emails, no phone number to call to get help. DON'T GET STUCK IN THE RUN AROUND!
