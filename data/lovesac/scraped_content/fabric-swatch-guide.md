I love my coasters. Use them all the time for hot and cold beverages and my thermos as well. They match my sactionals table.

We got a new rug! And, when you have a lovesac Sactional, that means time for a new arrangement!
Actually, this is our second new rug in the last couple weeks. I still LOVE our old rug (the patterned one in the fourth pic) but I didn‚Äôt like it with the color of our new couch. Our first new rug (fifth pic) added lots of texture and was super soft underfoot, but it was wool and shed like crazy!! I knew it would some, but was unprepared for just how much fuzz would be ALL over our house. I couldn‚Äôt stand it, so we packaged it back up.
We rolled out our second new rug this morning and since this one is synthetic, it shouldn‚Äôt shed. Is a light color practical with 2 kids and a dog? No. But it looks good with the couch and our Shoji White walls! It was a good price for a rug this size so while I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôll get 10 years out of it like our last one, I‚Äôll be happy with it while it lasts.
This is our third layout to test out with the Sactional and it might be my favorite one yet. We tried out a big L-shaped couch to start with, then switched to two love seat couches with one having 2 chaises. And now we have a longer couch and a chair/chaise.
Here‚Äôs the official review on the lovesac: we don‚Äôt like it. We LOVE it!!! It is SO comfortable and soft. If you know me well at all, you know I‚Äôm an afternoon napper. This couch does not disappoint - I can be out cold within minutes! üòÜ The fabric color is not as dark as I thought it would be, but it has grown on me. It did have a smell when we initially unpacked it, but it‚Äôs starting to fade away. We‚Äôve spot cleaned one area but haven‚Äôt had to put any of it in the washing machine yet. And we‚Äôre getting really good at taking it apart and reassembling it! Hopefully this new rug is a keeper and it can stay in this layout for a while.
Don‚Äôt judge the rest of the room. I‚Äôm shopping for a new coffee table and throw pillows and you can see I‚Äôm testing out two different curtain fabrics on the windows. Finding the right rug was the first step!
