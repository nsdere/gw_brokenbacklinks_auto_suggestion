Customer Reviews
Simple, Easy, Best Experience Ever!!!
Our Sactional with StealthTech + Charge arrived six days after purchase, which was exceptional since all 20 boxes were delivered simultaneously. The packaging was excellent, and there was no damage. The assembly was as straightforward as the instructional videos indicated. The Sactionals are solidly built, sturdy, and durable. The chargers operate perfectly. We absolutely love it!

Amazing System!
The product has been absolutely amazing! We did have an issue with the left side speaker. We got back from vacation and the speaker was completely blown and the wireless charging was not working. I contacted customer service on Monday and by Friday I had a replacement on my doorstep! Amazing service!

Awesome Sound and being hidden is a bonus
We've had our system setup for over a year now and it has been PERFECT. The sound is awesome, our only regret is we didn't get more of the side speakers.

Very happy with our Sactional + StealthTech
Pros:
-Helpful in-store service and post-purchase support
-The product shipped FAST. The build quality seems solid and the sactional looks great in our space
-The assembly was relatively easy and intuitive.
-We purchased the “Lovesoft” fill and deep seating and the couch has been comfortable out of the gate.
Cons:
-Assembly takes a while. Be prepared for tons of boxes and leftover cardboard.
-The StealthTech system sounds great but has a couple of annoying quirks.
-Wireless charging on the sides has been useless and the corded power hub is difficult to access without removing the bottom cushion.

A feature we didn’t know we needed. Love it
An upgrade we didn’t know we needed. We love this feature and how we can watch live concert streams to great movies. We love the bass in the seat and how it makes you feel like you in the movies.

Lovesac immersive speaker review
I like how loud the sound is and how it give you a real surround affect! Would highly recommend. Would be great for family movie nights or when you have family and friends over.

Happy with the upgrade
Better than we thought even after testing it in the showroom. We love it so much. Super versatile— takes some practice to get the modes correct but it’s great!

Beyond happy
Ok first off you have to understand I've been looking for a sectional for 7 years. 7! We moved into our new house in 2017 which has a very large but awkward size living room. I knew we needed a sectional but nothing currently on the market was the right size. I finally decided to look at Lovesac and it's been perfect. I created a sectional exactly in the dimensions I needed. I ended up even being able to add what I thought was going to be an ottoman as another seat so three people can lay at the same time. I plan to add another seat in the near future. No other brand would allow me to be able to add on. It also was perfect as we have a new puppy and a very energetic 9 year old who has already flipped his way onto the couch. It didn't even move. I'm confident it will hold up but even if it doesn't i can replace any part I need to without replacing an entire couch. Well worth my money but I do recommend configuring in store. It is complicated if you want to have deep versus standard. Watch the videos, take your time, and the set up ist definitely do able.

Hidden and sounds great take it from a tech geek!
Love the sound! hidden but what a great idea. Take it from a tech geek

Showroom Experience
Not only do I love the sectionals, the StealthTech system gave us that showroom experience. I’ve read about some people having to unplug the system to regain the connection. I have lost it once, but instead of unplugging the system I just went to my Bluetooth list in my iPhone settings. One touch of the StealthTech connection and I was back in business. I highly recommend trying that first.
