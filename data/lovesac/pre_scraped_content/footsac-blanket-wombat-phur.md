The Best for Winter Comfort
I enjoy this blanket so much. The dogs and I snuggle up in it every time I sit down. We are no longer cold. Love the way it keeps my feet warm.

Footsac Heaven
Santa left me the footsac under the tree this year. Must say this is the cozyiest and most luxurious blanket I've ever felt! I can't say for sure it's a de-stresser, but I sure feel warm and relaxed!!

Great blanket!
This is a fantastic product and my wife and I frequently snuggle under it while watching a movie late at night! It feels very soft and luxurious to the touch. So far it has held up well, and feels like it will continue to do so. We use the foot pocket once in a while and it is useful for colder nights, though we donâ€™t use it all the time.
