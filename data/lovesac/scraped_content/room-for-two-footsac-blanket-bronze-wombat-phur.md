I loved mine. I lost it in the divorce

I've purchased 3 different footsacks. I loved them all...but i guess my ex-wife did too because she literally took every single one in the divorce. I loved it so much that i actually listed in the divorce as something i wanted. So did she. My lawyer was like "are you kidding me? It's a blanket?" I said "thats exactly what she said when i told her the price I paid... Before it was delivered. But obviously it's not 'just as blanket' or she would not have stolen all 3." I'm dead serious. We argued over all three blankets, but this bronze wombat (i purchased the footsack for 2 but same fabric) is on another level. I never did get my blanket back. She argued with me while we were married for purchasing it. And when i purchased 2 more (different fabrics.) that matched other room decor (i have 2 love sacs also. She would've snuck out with those too if she could carry them. I'm sure of it)

So, if you buy this, put it in a prenup... trust me.
