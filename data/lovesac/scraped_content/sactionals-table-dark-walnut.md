Sactionals Table
Love it! Easy to use, practical, and easy to move.

C Chris Verified Buyer 2/1/24
Great addition
Great addition to our sactional. We put it on the base we use as a hassock to make a table or on the base next to where we are sitting to put remotes/drinks/etc on.

N Neil Verified Buyer 7/9/23
Great accent piece.
Solid piece of material. Serves the intended purpose.

L Lynn Verified Buyer 5/28/23
Yes, you need it.
This useful and sturdy piece is one of the most used items in our house. We didn’t even know how much we needed it and are so glad we made the purchase.

S Shelbie L. 5/3/23
The perfect table for us
The perfect table for us :) our little one year old loves hanging on to the couch and then adding this piece allows her to use a safe table as well! It’s the perfect addition to our couch

D Deb K. 8/7/22
An awesome table to put over a Love Sac cushion
It's a real conversation piece! Our dogs didn't find it the least bit interesting to nibble on. Love it!

A Anne D. 3/21/22
No additional footprint.
Easy to use/clean. Minimalist appearance. Fits cushion perfectly. Colors to match any interior. Great idea!

T Tricia N. 3/6/22
We had our lovesac couch for 3 years prior to finally buying the table and cup holders.

Wish I had done it sooner! They’re great!
