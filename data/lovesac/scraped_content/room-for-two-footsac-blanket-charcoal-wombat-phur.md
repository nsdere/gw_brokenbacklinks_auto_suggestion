Wombat all day long! I wish it was larger but the comfort of this footsac demands five stars. Enjoy!

The Best Blanket Ever!

This blanket is amazing! Almost should have not gotten it for my wife! She cuddles and holds it more than me now! Feels so good.

Love these but the stitching is poor

I own multiple footsacs and the stitching is poor. I do use mine in a daily basis and wash them on delicate and hang dry. But I think they need to stitch the footing with something more durable. I am a huge fan but canâ€™t continue to buy these for myself or gifts until they fix this quality control issue. ðŸ˜•
