Sac Of Wood is terrific! Beautiful wood! Excellent fit and stays put on the sectional. Can also be used standing on one end next to sectional for laptop use.

Features: Style  
So convenient I bought two of these to go along with out sactional and we really use them. It’s nice because they can go on the seats or on the ottomans. They match our floors so that’s a plus too. They’re sturdy so that means they’re heavy but the quality is there.

Great alternative to a coffee table! Love this little table. Allows us to have an ottoman when we need it and a table when we need it without swapping out entire pieces of furniture.
