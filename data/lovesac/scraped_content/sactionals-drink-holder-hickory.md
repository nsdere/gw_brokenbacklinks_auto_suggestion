- **Kelley 6/8/24**: Awesome accessory. Love the tall drink holder for the kids for spills!
- **Reesie Verified Buyer 2/26/24**: Versatile Drink Holders. I enjoy that these drink holders can be moved to any side of the couch. I have a total of 4 and when I have the couch configured in an L shape I can still have places for drink on the back side of the couch for people in the middle. The only improvement I would suggest is for a way to accommodate a handle for coffee mugs.
- **ww Verified Buyer 7/29/23**: The drink holder works well and keeps me from knocking over drinks. Fits perfectly.
- **B-Rad Verified Buyer 7/27/23**: Great purchase! This rules, couldn’t recommend it enough for a love sac couch.

- **Amy M. 5/3/23**: Great cupholder for my Lovesac sofa, helps to keep from spilling drinks, inset is deep and keeps stemless glasses stable.
- **Alexandria L. 12/12/22**: Worth every penny. Seriously, the best. If you’re on the fence, just BUY it.
