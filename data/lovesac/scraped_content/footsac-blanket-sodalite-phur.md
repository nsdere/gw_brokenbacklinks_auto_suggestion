- **DYLAN B.** 10/11/22: "Why do we make blankets with any other materials? We only need this material anymore. Cool and comfortable."
- **Marco L.** 1/7/21: "This blanket is amazing! Great size, beautiful and the space for foot is awesome! Great job."
- **Lu** 8/28/20: "The best blanket ever. The weight, the feel, the softness is incredible. I need one of these for every member of my family because now my children are fighting for it."
- **Kiersten J.** 8/28/22: "This blanket is just okay. Definitely too expensive for the quality. I’ve washed mine 4 times and it still reeks. It also leaves you covered in fur. Would not buy again."
