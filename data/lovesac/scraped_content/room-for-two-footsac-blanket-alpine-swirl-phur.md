This Blanket is EVERYTHING

This blanket is the best blanket. I use it every day, even in the summer. My husband gets frustrated that I turn the air down...it's just so soft!

My fav blanket EVER!

I highly recommend this blanket! The lovesac is a game changer with how you are chilling & watching movies and this blanket is the perfect fit! I love that you can tuck your feet into the little pocket and it keeps you so toasty! I have the double and you can easily fit two adults in here. I also feel like the fabric is really awesome. I never feel static after getting up from using this blanket. Our fam fights over this blanket :) You don't overheat, it is just enough warmth. I know it seems like a lot for a blanket but this is unlike any blanket you have and is really a must have for any lovesac :)

A bit scratchy but great

I love the footsac blankets but the alpine one is not nearly as soft as wombat phur. It's almost scratchy. Still love it though

Not great overtime

Got this as a gift 5yrs ago. When first received it was amazing, super soft and plush. However after a couple washes and a year it no longer had the same softness and was definitely not worth the expensive price. It's still a nice blanket but definitely not worth the high price tag.
