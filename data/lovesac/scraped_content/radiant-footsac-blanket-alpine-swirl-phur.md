  - Best thing ever
  - This blanket was a gift from my boyfriend for Christmas. I am extremely cold natured and this really helps. Wish there was a right and left sided plug-in option because the left side plug-in does not work for me.

  - Hard pass
  - It is not the same great quality as the original footsac I bought. Looks cheap and doesn't heat evenly. I very much have buyers remorse.

Don't waste money on this heated blanket.
