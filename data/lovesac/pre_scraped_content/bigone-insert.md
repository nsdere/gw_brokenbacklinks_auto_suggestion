Edgar P. 5/3/23 Features: Washability Sac Size: The BigOne It has to be the BIG ONE Too comfortable. I close my eyes and it feels like I'm floating. My home productivity had diminished as I find myself debating to get up now or 5 more minutes? All my friends come over and say it's too big! After getting on it, ALL have said..."so, how much is this" and "send me the link". Share Was this review helpful? (4) (0)
