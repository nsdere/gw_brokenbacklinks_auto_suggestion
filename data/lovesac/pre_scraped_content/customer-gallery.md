I love my coasters. Use them all the time for hot and cold beverages and my thermos as well. They match my sactionals table.

Absolutely beautiful color. Looks so great with the taupe padded velvet. We got rid of our coffee table when we upgraded and this added a nice accent table.

Clark Family Room
This freshly designed family room will definitely be the gathering place for everyone in the Clark family to convene and relax together.
I love the layered textures of this room and how it’s neutrally styled.
This room is a showstopper 🤩
It just might be my favorite room I’ve ever designed + styled.
Well, let’s be honest, I say that every.single.time 😂
What’s your favorite aspect of this room? Comment below 👇🏻

While the Sactional is wonderful it looks more impressive in a small room than the room can bear. Similar to driving a small car next to a 18-wheeler. While fitting you’d wish there were a smaller version available.

I decided to get the Wombat Phur blanket because the one I got previously i didn’t care for the fur and it wasn’t that soft and cuddly. This blanket is incredibly soft! I love the foot pockets also. By far my favorite material so far! Quality is great and it does have a little weight to it but isn’t too heavy for me. Cat approved also lol.
