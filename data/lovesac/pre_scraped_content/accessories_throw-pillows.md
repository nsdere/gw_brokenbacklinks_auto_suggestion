Fluffy goodness! It is so soft and fluffy. we love it! well made and the zipper is sturdier.

Nap Friendly 10/10 I sleep on it every night accidentally. Also a nice aesthetic

Lovely fabric Soft and didn’t shed cozy on a cold day, not too hot on a warm day

Woo Hoo Once everything comes together YOU WILL BE SO HAPPY WITH YOUR NEW SET UP!!!

Sooo soft and beautiful! It's so soft! Easy wash and put back on! I have four dogs and three kids and somehow it still looks clean and it's easy to spot clean as well.

Comfy and Warm My family bought The Big One for Christmas, and it was huge! Hence the name. It was super soft and I was actually able to sleep in it, which is saying something since I’m sensitive about where I sleep. Something to know however is the more you use it, the smaller it gets, probably the foam condensing or something. You also should flip it every so often so the foam doesn’t clump too much. It’s difficult with the big one, it makes my fingers hurt. I recommend the Big One, but if you don’t want a giant one, then get the CitySac or MovieSac.

Worth it This thing hugs me like my parents never did. Also roomy enough for my dog to chill with me. Definitely worth it.

Love it! We bought this several years ago and it’s wonderful and comfy! Even our dog loves it!

Do not buy another bean bag!!! I’ve always wanted a Lovesac and finally did it when my bf and I moved into our new apt. The supersac is HUGE but like so great for a 6’ and 5’ girl. The filling is soft but sturdy and solid. We’ve tried courdaroy and it was barely filled, my Lovesac is BUSTING out the seams in the best way lol. At first we were shocked at how big it was but it gets worn in the more you sit in it and it feels more solid but so comfy. I will say if you are unsure about the supersac and the size smaller, you might wanna play it on the safe side and go with the smaller one. The supersac is a unit, but best for 2 people to sit. I got the dove channelled phur cover and it’s stunning and quality is amazing so freaking soft. The most elegant bean bag you’ll ever see. I need the pouf to come back in stock and definitely eyeing the footsac in the same phur as well. ALSO things you might not consider but CUSTOMER SERVICE is elite with Lovesac!!! I have emailed and called and my problems were solved right away and very professionally. After we got the Courdaroy Queen, it really solidified how great the Supersac is. All around quality is TOP NOTCH. You will not regret this purchase. My experience with other company mentioned was mid and took much longer to ship. The photo makes it look small bc I’m sitting on the edge but trust it’s huge.

Love my cover This cover is so soft and I love that it is machine washable.
