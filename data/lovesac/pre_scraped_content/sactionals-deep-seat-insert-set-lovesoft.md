amazing sactional
this sactional is super comfortable and very well made and designed. the overall quality is some of the best I have seen. it was some what cumbersome to actually assemble. I did do it all on my own and took several hours while i complained the whole time that I spent this much on furniture and had to put it together myself. once I was done i was completely satisfied and the complaining went away and I actually had fun putting it all together. the complaint i do have is I designed a specific layout because of the space I have and it would have been nice to have a schematic for my particular pieces and even though I e-mailed requesting they kept referring me to the list available and none of them where what i ordered. I felt liked i was just being pushed away and no one took the time to go into my account and see what I ordered. I gave up and figured it out on my own. overall i was satisfied and love my new sactional.

Not as comfortable as expected
The cushion compresses and is not soft to sit on. Like a feather pillow. Hard on the behind. Hard to fluff back up.

Fill not consistent over time.
Purchased a few inserts to extend our couch that's maybe 4 years old. The new stuffing is much stiffer and the cushions are fuller (lovesoft fill) so there is an obvious difference between the old and new. I even had to do a double take and look at the tags because it felt like standard fill and not the lovesoft of the rest of my couch. I hope the new will wear down to match the old over time. We put the new cushions in the spots we sit in most. It's been 3 months and there's still a 1" difference between the cushions. Just beware that if you do add pieces that they will not be consistent fill.

Nice deep seats
The sectional is not easy to assemble but has a solid build and plenty of room for many. The pillows need puffing up daily. Overall we could have saved a bit of money and found something just as comfortable with some patient shopping.
