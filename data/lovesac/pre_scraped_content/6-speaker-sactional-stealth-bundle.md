Lovesac immersive speaker review
I like how loud the sound is and how it give you a real surround affect! Would highly recommend. Would be great for family movie nights or when you have family and friends over.

So happy we did this!
This is a super cool immersive experience! With the speakers in the arms of the couch it's amazing how it focuses the sound and removes background noises. The arm chargers are a pretty cool add on. They are not fast charge but still great.

Very happy
We were on the fence about purchasing the system because it’s a big expense for something that is not a necessity, however we love it now and are glad we did it.

Happy every time I sit down
We have owned Lovesac for 8 years and have been impressed with the quality of the pieces. We had a flood and some if it was damaged, but customer service was great in helping us replace what was needed. We have reconfigured so many times and love the easy of change. Adding the stealthtech system to the arrangement was super easy and we love the new sound and ease of charging devices. Lovesac just keeps getting better all the time.

Spectacular sound
Love Love Love the Immersive Sound + Charge System. I have been looking to add surround sound to my living room for sometime now. As soon as I saw this system I knew I had to have it. Ordering online was smooth and it was delivered without delay. The set up was easy. I did have a issue with connecting the sound bar to the subwoofer, but that was user error. Just take the time to read the instructions and you should not have any problems. The Harman Kardon sound is spectacular. It sure does make movie night feel like your at the theater. I just wish I could connect my two other wireless Harman Kadon speakers.

The sound system is great. The wireless charging is not so great. Phone overheats and the the surface is not flat. It's lopsided.

Brilliant
This is a gift sent from the gods. I didn't think I could love my Sactional more but then these integrated speakers showed up!
I would give them 1 million stars except there are a couple of things that aren't totally perfect. First off, it didn't mention anywhere when ordering, that these are actual sides and not inserts. I now have more sides than I need. Not the end of the world, just would've been nice to know prior to their arrival. Second, not a fan of the cords... I know the quality is better when it's hard wired but I really like rearranging (I mean, isn't that why we buy the Sactional??) and the cords make it difficult when moving things around. Again, not a huge deal but no mention of this fact anywhere in the description. Lastly, the charging station makes the phones HOT. We just don't use it, which is too bad because I was super excited for that feature. Do I still love this system? 100 percent. The sound quality is phenomenal, the ability to change the sub and sound is awesome and really allows customization, my friends and family are always surprised and jealous by how cool it is when they come over now for fight night or movie night!

Great sound, but frustrating to operate!
The sound is great. It would have been easier to install if we just bought the lovesac but we had to take it all apart and basically put it back together. The biggest issue is it is seems to have a lot of glitches...the app does not work most of the time and I am forced to use yet another remote to operate it. It does not seem to stay connected to the TV very well either and I am constantly having to change the audio output to the Sound system (I have a brand new LG TV so it should be pretty smooth).

Stopped working after 2 weeks
The side speakers stopped working after 2 weeks and customer service was slow to respond and not at all helpful.
The side chargers stop charging after a couple of minutes and charge at an almost imperceptible speed.
At this point its only quality is the cordless look.
