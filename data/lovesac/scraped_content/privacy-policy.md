Third Party Websites and Social Media
Our website or mobile applications may contain links to other websites, and other websites may reference or link to our website or mobile applications. These other domains and websites are not controlled by us and are governed by their own privacy policies. We encourage our users to read the privacy policies of each and every website and application that they interact with. We do not endorse, screen or approve, and are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of such other websites or applications. Visiting these other websites or applications is at your own risk.
For example, if you choose to use a third-party payment option (such as Paypal) to pay for any orders that you place, its privacy statement and security practices will apply to your information. We encourage you to read that privacy statement before providing your information.
Our website and mobile applications also contain links and interactive features with various social media platforms. If you already use these platforms, their cookies may be set on your device when using our website or mobile applications. You should be aware that Personal Information which you voluntarily include and transmit online in a publicly accessible blog, chat room, social media platform or otherwise online, or that you share in an open forum may be viewed and used by others without any restrictions.

Security
We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect the confidentiality and security of information transmitted to us. To guard your information delivered to us electronically, our websites and mobile applications use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology. SSL encrypts your credit card number, name and address so only we are able to decode your information. Unfortunately, however, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your contact information, to the extent permitted by law, we do not guarantee or warrant the security of any information you transmit to or from our website or mobile applications, and you do so at your own risk.
We urge you to keep any password that you establish with us in a safe place and not to divulge it to anyone. Also, remember to log off your account and close your browser window or mobile application when you have finished your visit. This is to ensure that others cannot access your account, especially if you are sharing a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public place.
