Best beanbag I've ever owned!
Very comfortable after I got the extra box of foam to put in it! If you're a bigger person and feel like you're touching the ground when you sit on the moviesac, I highly recommend requesting the extra foam from customer service. Shipping was very quick and improved the comfort a lot! Very happy with my purchase overall!

Fits two adult humans or one spoiled dog
Super cozy! Be sure to give it a good two days without the cover on to let it fluff up - this is absolutely vital to getting it to its proper size. We have a dog bed, but she much prefers the Lovesac. It was supposed to be my reading seat (and I do find itâ€™s comfortable enough for that in combo with the squattoman) but she takes it more often.

Spend the money, you will love it!
I love this thing! I almost wish I hadnâ€™t gotten a couch at all and gotten several of these instead. Itâ€™s so comfortable and when I can get the cat to move, itâ€™s my favorite place to sit and watch tv or read. Would definitely purchase again! This size is perfect for me and a cat or 2. Itâ€™s also a good size to snuggle up with one other human, as long as youâ€™re both on the small-medium size.

Glad I Made the Decision to Get Lovesacs
Iâ€™m so happy that I was finally able to purchase from lovesac. It took me a few years to give in just because their expensive, but it was worth it. I have really been enjoying the Movie Sac as well as the rest of my family. I purchased 3. They are very comfortable and makes me want to fall asleep all the time in them. If I had more space I would have went with the Big One. I like the height of the Movie Sac because even my toddler is able to climb up and get in there. The size is pretty good because it doesnâ€™t take up too much space but itâ€™s enough for me and my child to sit in and watch a movie. The cover is so soft that I ordered which is the Sodalite Phur and is perfect. The cover is like having one of those plush blankets underneath you which is great for cool seasons and when you have your central air on cool. I will be purchasing second covers and their foot stools too.
