Love the easy of use
I love the easy to charge your electronics. I use to purchase long cords and tuck them in the cushions. Someone would end up moving it, this one you can’t because it is in the couch. We purchased two for each end of the couch.

Love being able to charge my phone while sitting on my couch.

Sharon 7/22/22
Love this item. Makes for easy hook up of cell phones and electrical hook up such as lamps and fan etc

A must have for us
A little bit awkward to access without removing cushions, but so worth it for convenience. Especially with our floating couch set up.

Works great, but could be better and lower priced
It was easy to retrofit my decade old sectional and keeps cords neatly hidden. I wish the power hub had two USB-C ports though. Another good idea would be to add an outlet in the extension cord line which runs under the seatbacks so that a floor lamp can be plugged in behind the couch. Even on sale, this was very expensive for a USB hub in a plastic housing at the end of an extension cord; hence the loss of one star.

Too expensive. Too hard to get to. Not worth it. Depends on the situation.

Not everything a was hoping for
Great idea, but creates some issues. The cords coming out of the hub just get in the way. There is no storage option so you would just have to shove them down the sides. You can’t really plug or unplug anything without removing the cushion first. I was really excited about this product, but it left me lacking. Also, some items just don’t charge. I guess they don’t get enough power, so my PS5 controllers don’t charge when plugged in. Real bummer.

Difficult to use
Overall good product, but the location and depth makes it very challenging to plug anything into. You must remove the cushion or just leave a cord plugged in.

Do not buy if you expect to use for USB charging
I bought three of these for our couch expecting I could use the USB charger...these are terrible and extremely low amperage for the price you pay. Would not recommend if this is how you plan on using them.

Lack of Power
We've had two of these for about 2 - 3 weeks now. The USB C would charge decent but with the slightest movement it would stop charging. We'd have to remove the cushions and unplug then plug back in but this happened all the time. The regular USB charges will charge but are extremely slow taking 10 + minutes to get 1% more charge. The convenience is great but I wish the power was better. For the price we are considering returning them.
