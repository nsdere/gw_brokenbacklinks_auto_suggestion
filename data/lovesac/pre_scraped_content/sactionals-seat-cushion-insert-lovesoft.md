Best Cushion
Personally, I much prefer the lovesoft cushion to the standard. I'm not sure yet how it will hold up over time, but if my experience with the standard cushion is any indication, then it should hold up very well.

We received, assembled and are now using our new sactional with Lovesoft cushions and we absolutely love them!! The seats are soft yet supportive, very, very comfy!! We feel that the back cushions are perfectly filled, sturdy but pliable enough to make them just right for however you are comfortable sitting. We're totally pleased with our purchase and, at this point, wouldn't change a thing!

VERY Comfortable
I'm not sure what everyone's complaint is, but I LOVE the LoveSoft filling. My daughter is allergic to down so this was a fabulous alternative! I splurged on this for a "plant throne" for my sunroom and I.plan to spend my morning tea and reading. time surrounded by plants. I didn't expect to notice the difference between this and the standard filling, but I definitely do. So much so. that I will replace the cushions on my M lounger and the movie lounger. I love this filling.

Great products that need just a little tweaking
We have the Lovesoft which is excellent. I agree with the review about the process to change cushions during the “trial period” or thereafter. Have to send in before others will ship out?? Cross-shipping should be an option with a credit card to charge if not returned and as a security deposit. The process to order or receive replacement pieces or cushions also seems to be extraordinarily long and feel his process should be significantly shortened and aligned with “quick ship”. These small improvements would help make Lovesac an even better company that demonstrates its commitment to superior customer service.
Would also like to see both on the website and in the showroom a cutaway of the cushions showing the differences and benefits. Having more options for bottom cushion edge firmness would also be nice. Would help avoid “falling in the crack”.

Seat cushion insert
Not quite as soft as the one I sat on before. Cushions thinner at edges.

Durability and Ordering
I dropped some decent money on a sectional. We upgraded coverings and went base on cushions. You’re lucky you can buy pieces because the base cushions don’t hold up well. Ordered 4 new cushions and was told 6-8 weeks just to get cushions! Never received updates. Finally called. It will end up being 4 months till I get couch cushions, just cushions! Look, these couches are not cheap and I feel like the quality, comfort and durability is just “okay”. Having dogs I do appreciate being able to replace parts and hopefully a company will replicate their model with something more durable and comfortable.
One plus, the customer service person was helpful and very pleasant.

Uncomfortable junk
Good in theory. Bad in practice. Bought this because the default cushion is even worse junk.

Completely over-priced and dishonest description
Just a regular cushion with a “pillowcase” over the top that has a very, very thin layer of fluff. I’m quite upset that I ordered it over the holidays and was too busy to return it. The description makes it sound like the entire cushion is made from Love soft. ITS NOT!!! You get maybe 1/4-1/2” of lovesoft material.
