To the Trade Membership Details

We are excited to work with you! Just a few nuts and bolts to keep in mind:

Membership

Lovesac’s To the Trade membership is not transferrable and is currently only available for trade professionals in the US. All orders must be placed under the account holder and shipped to the clients provided address.

Misuse of membership privileges may result in membership termination. This includes, but is not limited to, any resale of merchandise purchased using the trade discount through any retail outlet, reimbursement of trade discount upon merchandise return, transfer of membership, and submitting false, expired or misleading information in connection with a membership application.

Trade Discount

Your To the Trade discount is 20% off MSRP, or an additional 5% off promotional offers, not to exceed 35%. Your discount is not valid with any other offers, on floor samples, sale/clearance items, on purchase of gift cards, shipping and processing fees or taxes. The trade discount is not redeemable for cash. Lovesac has the right to adjust the trade discount at any time.

Shipping

All orders ship for free via FedEx drop ship. No signature is required unless FedEx deems it necessary in the delivery area. Our quick ship fabrics have lead times of 1-2 weeks from order placement. Custom fabric order lead times can vary up to 10 weeks, depending on the fabric choice. Tracking information will be available once the order has shipped and will be sent to the email provided on your membership application.

Taxes

Sales tax exemption is applicable only in the US and to those who have a valid reseller’s license or tax identification number. To be tax exempt at Lovesac store locations, a copy of the corresponding Tax-Exempt Certificate must be included in the application. Otherwise, sales tax will be applied. Tax exemptions will not be adjusted/refunded at a later date if not present at the original time of purchase.

Forms of Payment

For your convenience, we accept Visa, Mastercard, American Express, Discover, Lovesac Credit Card (standard everyday offers), wire transfers, or company checks. All orders are held until payment information is received. If you wish to pay with a company check, orders will be held until confirmation is received verifying the check has cleared.

Return Policy

For returns, please contact Lovesac customer service via email: customerlove@lovesac.com or by phone: (888) 636-1223 to arrange the return shipping process. You have 30 days from the ship date of your order to return your purchase. Any returns after the 30-day period will be subject to store credit. Custom items are a final sale and not eligible for return or refund.
