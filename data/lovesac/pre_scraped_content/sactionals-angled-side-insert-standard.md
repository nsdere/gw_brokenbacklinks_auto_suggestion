Customer Reviews
Great Design
Nice option and happy we chose the Angled Side. The Angled Side adds to the comfort of the Sactional.

Lovesac was perfect for our home. Being able to reconfigure on a whim has been great for entertaining. My only hiccup was ordering for a store it didn't come configure the way we wanted and ended up having to order more pieces. Really wish the angle sides cup holder was more secure for cups. Deep seats are perfect for taller people and lounging. Covers are easily cleaned.

PLEASE MAKE THE ANGLED BACK HIGHER
I have used the angled sides for over 7 months. This is my suggestion: Lovesac should have Angled side for the back. The height of this is mid-back and it is too low and uncomfortable.
Please make angler sides that are at least 7 inches taller and slightly less angled for proper back support. There should also be tall back pillows to support the taller sides.
