Features
Sac Bundles
Save when you bundle up. Bundles are available in three fabrics and with your choice of Squattoman, Footsac, or both. Pick the bundle combination that’s best for you and save 30%!

Sac
Sacs may look like a beanbag, but they are so much more. The super-soft fill is made of premium shredded Durafoam™ which, unlike bead-filled bags, absorbs body weight evenly and doesn't compress over time.

The BigOne: 6' x 4’1” Footsac
This Footsac blanket does so much more than keep you cozy on the couch (although it does that very well). Along the bottom of the blanket is an 18" pocket for your feet, which means that you will never again struggle to keep your whole body covered.
