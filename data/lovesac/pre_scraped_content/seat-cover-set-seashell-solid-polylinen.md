Stunning color durable fabic
Very pleased with the fsbric and color. We have a log home and the color is a stricking contrast to the log walls. I love decorating with different colors for each season. This is a slightly off white that blends with anything.

Love love love the color and the functionality.
Love the color and the comfort and functionality. I have two boys and had concerns about the color and getting dirty. Love that the covers are removable and machine washable. I haven’t washed them yet but have had to spot clean an area or two, cleans up very well.

Comfort and color are A+.
Comfort and color are A+. My big issue with the poly linen is that dog hair and other material get trapped in the fibers and don’t come out when washed. So if functionality, it loses some points.

We love the color and
We love the color and comfort of our sofa! We don’t like how the Seashell solid polylinen gets all type of lint on it and hair which stays stuck between the weaving. It’s a hassle to remove.

Started Foam Structure not Holding Up, and Purchase Problems
The cushions are going soft already. After less then a years amount of use, the backs and bottoms foam structure do not appear to be holding up well.
We missed a lovesac sale when we went to purchase because our color lovesac couch (parts to a set which we already own) were completely taken off the website. So that forced is to purchase at a higher price of point because we could not reliably wait for the next sale to complete our set.
Also shipping was super slow. Altogether it's not been a great experience.

Uncomfortable
The Seashell Solid Polylinen is beautiful, but it is rough feeling - like a plastic burlap or canvas.

DO NOT BUY
Color is beautiful however it is extremely scratchy and stiff making it uncomfortable to sit on for a long time. Not to mention the fact that it looks very dirty since the lint gets stuck in it.
