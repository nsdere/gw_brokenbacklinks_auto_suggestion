Ease of use
It is a workout to put the whole thing together but I have already had to wash the covers due to a child's spill and they cleaned up beautifully!

Love the storage
Storage is one of the other reasons for picking the sactional. I can store my many blankets out of sight. We also use the Ottoman for game boards.

I love my sactional
I Love my Sactional. Best purchase that I have made in a long time. Delivery was fast. Installation was long but worth it. Very solid and sturdy. Hope to buy few more pieces soon.

Pleasantly Surprised
I was surprised by the quality (and I'm an extreme optimist). Very pleased, and as I replace other furniture (that my dog chews) I will replace with Lovesac.

Great couch, cat approved
The whole couch is exactly what I wanted, and was fairly easy to put together. And unlike the sectional my parents had when I was a kid, this one has stayed together despite me collapsing down onto it after a long day. Most importantly, the cat likes this couch more than my old couch, and I can store my camping gear in the seat where the cat can't get it.
