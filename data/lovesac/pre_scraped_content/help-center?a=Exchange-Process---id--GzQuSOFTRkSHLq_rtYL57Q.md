Exchange Process

You can initiate an exchange with our Customer Love team or any of our Showrooms for any eligible item within 60-Days of delivery. Be sure to have your order information ready.

Once you have started an exchange you will need to get the items being returned packaged up in a similar fashion to the way they were delivered. You may use any packaging you have available. For some larger items (Seat Inserts, Side Insert, and Sac Inserts) Lovesac can provide packaging upon request. We do not provide boxes for Covers or Accessories.

Covers need to be removed from Inserts and packaged separately to ensure the timely processing of your return.

Once packaged and ready to ship, Lovesac provides pre-paid return shipping labels for you via email and can schedule a pickup for you as well. Please reach out if you are in need of a label.

Once the item has been received and verified, we will release the replacement items to ship.
