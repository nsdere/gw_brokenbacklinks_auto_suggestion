Good purchase
It was fairly easy to use! However they didn't send the directions which was sad but I'll live. I'd recommend to anyone who needed to gain their space back while also wanting to keep their lovesac!

Worth it
I actually managed to compress the sac insert with a regular vacuum. It took a while, of course, but it worked and that’s what matters. The shrink bag has held up, no rips or tears and it’s fairly easy to carry using the handles.

Multiple Sacs can fit in one kit
I have 2 city sacs and I purchased the super sac shrink city by mistake. I was going to try it out and if I liked it buy another. Ends up both city sacs fit in perfectly. You jut need to tack one on top of the other. Also, to make it easier we zip tied the shrink bag around the shop vac hose. I left a longer review under that size if you care to read it. But if you have two city sacs you can save some money and just buy the super sac kit.

Air is 14 PSI. Inside this it's less.
I own the Citysac, which is one of the smaller Luvsac models. I bought this to facilitate moving and storing the chair more easily. Anybody who has moved knows how difficult moving is in general, and the Lovesac is no exception to that. In fact, if you are moving with your Lovesac, I strongly recommend that you purchase this item or at least know how to compress your chair to a manageable size and fixed shape. My package came with two bags for the Lovesac and one duffel bag. I put the lovesac into the huge plastic bag, gathered up the wide opening of the bag around the end of the vacuum hose, and turned the vacuum on. It took a few minutes to pull most of the air out--even my wimpy vacuum cleaner was strong enough to compress the Lovesac down to a reasonable size. I think you could, if you had a faster vacuum or a vacuum pump get the chair down to a very small size if you really needed to. Next I placed the Lovesac into the duffel and zipped it up. If the air comes back into the plastic bag, it will be ok now that the duffel is zipped. The whole package is about the same size as the original duffel that the Lovesac came in.
The instructions said to remove the cover for the Lovesac. I can see why they advise this--to prevent the zipper on the cover from puncturing the plastic bag as it squeezes down on the Lovesac. But I was careful, and I didn't do this step. Alltogether I'm glad I got this, and I wish I had bought this when I first got my Lovesac several years ago,.

Works as intended, but you
Works as intended, but you need a really powerful vacuum (we used a shop vac).

Easy, took like 20 minutes.
I'm moving from AZ to NC and wanted to take my CitySac. I bought this kit and followed the instructional YouTube video posted by the company. I had a friend help me, and we were easily able to shrink and pack my sac using a small shop vac. While shrinking, we pushed it into another piece of furniture and accidentally tore a hole in the bag and couldn't continue. I slapped some duct-tape on it and it was good to go. The whole process was very simple and I'm glad I won't have to worry about transporting a giant full-sized sac in my car!

Works with Effort
I just bought this to put away our City Sac that was being chewed up by our rabbit until we could find a better spot for it.
Pros:
-includes instructions
-includes extra plastic storage bags
-storage duffle is quite durable and should hold it securely.
-Easy to get plastic bag around sac
Cons:
-No way to seal the bag before removing air (its an open-ended bag that you twist around. If it were something you could zip closed and then add a one-way air valve I think it would go far better.
-Sac took several attempts to get to correct form to fit in duffle bag. I had to lay on it to get it in the right shape and keep the vaccum on and running while zipping up the bag.
Timeline:
It took some time to get this into the duffle case. It started with me clearing the area so the plastic bag wouldn't tear on anything. I rolled the bag down around the sides and then flipped the bag over to finish getting the sac in the plastic bag. Then I tried to do the twist around where the vacuum would go in, and there was A LOT of plastic to try and hold onto - it is not easy if you have small hands. You have to put the vacuum hose on the sac itself, or it will keep catching the plastic. After attempt 1, it was the wrong shape (too high up) so I dragged it to another room with more space. This is where I started to lay on top of it when vacuuming. It got to the right shape, but then air kept getting in when trying to zip up the bag. It wasn't until I kept vacuuming and closed 3/4 of the duffle bag that I finally closed it all up.
What I would have done differently: Ask for a second person to help me. One person on vacuum duty, the other on fitting the sac in the duffle and zipping the bag.

Eventually worked
It fit my city sac but took a lot of work. My Dyson vacuum kept overheating and shutting off midway through. But on the sixth try I got it. The vacuum bag itself is just an enormous plastic bag. If it were more shaped to the city sac it would have been a lot easier. As it was, I had a lot of extra bag that was hard to roll up and get in the duffel before the sac started expanding again. Super annoying considering how expensive it was.
