Drink Holders are a Must Have

Hunker down and don't leave the Sactional!
Best ever!!! I get all cozy in my sectional with my book or movie and put my drink in my cup holder and don't move!

Everyone Loves the Cup Holders
I initially purchased 2 cup holders and everyone asks me when Everyone asks when will I purchase more...so I finally ordered 2 more to arrive before Thanksgiving Day gathering. I love the intelligent design and well-thought product accessories. Gotta Love My Lovesac - My forever couch!!!

Donâ€™t hesitate and buy these!
Perfect accessory! Love having a cup holder on each side of the couch. Helps elevate reaching across others and makes less accidents from the kids. Everyone comments about them when they are over. Brilliant idea

Great customization options
Great customization for the Sactionals. I use it as a remote control holder but it works.
I purchased multiple holders. Very functional
