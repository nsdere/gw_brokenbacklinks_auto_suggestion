- Liz 3/18/24: Crisp white and ultra soft! Super soft even after washing. My favorite thing about this blanket is the phur is on both sides unlike two others I purchased (snow owl and silver wolf) both only had the soft fur on one side and something else on the other. This blanket is also heavier than the others.
- Sandy Verified Buyer 1/8/24: Warm is on my side! My footsac is great! I love it! It really keeps me warm & makes me warm up fast.
- Tracy E. 5/3/23: I love the weight of the footsac! I gifted my husband with the footsac for Christmas. He was tickled. His feet get cold and this is the perfect blanket. It was a fun surprise that it has 2 foot pockets, one for me too!!
- Andrea 11/6/22: Best Blanket Ever. I didn't realize I needed this. It is the best blanket ever. Best couch accessory. Best everything.
- Kristin C. 9/23/22: Ultimate Coziness. These blankets are really awesome! Our family loves them. They are so soft and cozy!
- Cathy 9/12/22: Love this! I’ve had my alpine swirl foot sac for at least 7 years and it’s held up really well. So well my husband has taken it, so I am buying him his own as his 2nd anniversary (cotton) gift. It gets washed monthly and is still amazing.
- Sam 7/19/22: Amazing. I’m in love with this blanket. I’ve had it for a few years now. It’s held up well throughout all its washes. Ultimate cozy level.
- David 6/27/22: Falls apart quickly. The Alpine Phur Swirl (previously named Eskimo Phur Swirl) is a terrible blanket in terms of long-lasting quality. It was great for the initial 4-6 months I used it. But after barely washing it (2 times), the product degraded quickly. The phur microfibers get everywhere. They even ended up in my daughter's eyes and I had to pick them out for her.

Conclusion

I wouldn't recommend this product for anyone to be honest. It doesn't help that the footsacs aren't covered by a warranty either (as per CS support).
