Best couch!!
This will be our couch for life. We have kids and pets and this couch withstands it all. I will never go back to having a traditional couch again. Washable covets and the ability to expand or switch things around. It is all perfect. And can I just add that everything that has been spilled on this couch has washed out without a trace. Two years later this couch looks brand new.

Works well
We love that you can love them around. Covers are a bit hard to get on but look great because of the snug fit.

Leather Sacsection
I love this sactional. It was simple to set up and it is very comfortable. One question: with the leather the back cushions constantly slide down flat. Is there a way to hold them upright and in place?
