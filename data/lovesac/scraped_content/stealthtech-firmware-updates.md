Sactional
This is the most comfortable couch I have ever sat on.  I will never have to buy another couch.  With all the options and warranties it’s worth every penny.

perfect for families!
Could not be more pleased!  We debated our purchase for a while. Went to the store and played with layouts and felt the fabrics and sat on the different options. Finally decided to do it and we consider it an investment as it is the last couch we will ever buy. Big enough for my hubby and I and our 4 dogs!  Super comfy, easy to clean, easy to move around. Best couch ever!!

Cushion insert
One of our seat cushions was starting to get soft, and it was beyond the warrenty, so decided to replace with a new standard seat cushion. What a difference the new one  made. Would be nice if lovesac had a longer warrenty on the cushions.

The Highest Quality Product Ever
I am blown away by the overall quality of everything Lovesac does. The Sactional itself is SUPER high quality, the fabric, the cushions, the construction, everything! PLUS, the way the products are packaged are extremely efficient and innovative. It has been the greatest furniture experience I have ever had. Absolutely 1000% worth every penny! My husband is now super jealous of my Sactional reading spot!
