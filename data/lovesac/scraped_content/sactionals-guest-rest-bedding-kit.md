Love! We purchased our Sactional in 2019 and have loved it ever since! Comfortable, fun, an easy to clean. We love it so much, we purchased an outdoor sactional for our She Shed. Great product, no complaints!

So comfortable and fun! We absolutely love this bedding kit. We have had a couple of guests since purchasing, and they have both commented on the comfort and just how awesome it is that we can do this with our couch. We have even arranged into a bed a few times just so my husband and I can sleep in the family room with the kids over the weekend…just for fun! It is very easy to use.

It’s my favorite piece of furniture!! OMG we love this couch!! It’s just been a few months, but it’s my favorite piece of furniture. Everyone in our family loves it. As a matter of fact, there is someone almost always sleeping on it all the time. I wish we had bought one sooner!!

Quite comfy but pricey
The mattress pad appears quite thin but it feels comfortable. Fits perfectly on the Sactional & storage ottoman. It is a little pricey for what it is.

Guest Rest Review
The guest rest kit is super comfortable, and it's easy to store when you aren't using it. Perfect for a small home without a proper guest room.

Comfortable and functional!
This was such a great purchase! We used it for the first time when my mom stayed over and I was nervous as she’s hard to please. She thought it was great!!! So much more comfortable than a traditional pull out couch, easy to assemble and disassemble!
