Drink holder for the win

Love the drink holder. It's sturdy and drinks don't fall out. It's a beautiful wood tone.

Just okay

The angled side drink holder is awkward to me. If I have a can of soda in the cup holder it easily gets pushed out and falls to the floor. The cup holder hole doesn't have a lip in the back of it so cups, cans and small mugs slide right out. Not sure why they chose this design. It's a big flaw in my opinion and I have 3 of them which I regret. Beautiful wood and craftsmanship though so 3 stars!

Angled drink holder poor design

The design of this drink holder is confusing to me. The hole is huge and not fully enclosed. I’m not sure what it is intended to hold but it isn’t an average sized water bottle or cup.

Okay but should be better

Coffee mug handle needs to face away from you and the lip that hold the drink should be in taller. With the poor design it should be much much cheaper.
