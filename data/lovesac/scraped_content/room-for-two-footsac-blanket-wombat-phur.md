  - **Review:** Absolutely love it. Everyone loves this blanket. Everyone. My fiance and I fall asleep under it accidentally on the couch. My nephews love petting it when they come visit. My cat burrows into it at night when it's unoccupied and stays nestled inside the footpouch for as long as she can.

### Conclusion

This blanket is so fuzzy and comfortable!! For those who get cold easily or live in chilly places, you (and your pets and family and other loved ones) will be delighted with this.
