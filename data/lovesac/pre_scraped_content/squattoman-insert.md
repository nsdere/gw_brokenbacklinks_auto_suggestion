Perfect to put your feet up, an extra seat or for kids. Great size, not heavy - love it

Perfect size, style, and fit! Goes so well with our MovieSac. Thank you for bringing ultimate comfort into our home.

I love my squattoman cover! It was an exact match for my pillowsack.

Perfect height and size with our Sactional. Well constructed easy to cover.

This has been the perfect addition to our LoveSac! Its firm yet comfortable enough to lounge in all day!

These have improved over the years. Amazingly versatile. I use it with my vanity and also my Lovesac interchangeably.

Love it! Itâ€™s so soft and fits perfectly in my living room.

This simple accessory adds immeasurably to your Total Comfort either in the LoveSac, OR the Sactional. Just love it. It's also easy to pickup and move around. You will not regret this purchase.

Great quality, easy to insert and very durable. Good height too when using with the city sac

The squattoman fits perfect with our Lovesac. Initially bought without the foot rest. Much better together and increased the comfort.
