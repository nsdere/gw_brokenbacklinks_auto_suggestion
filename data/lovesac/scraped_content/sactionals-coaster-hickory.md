- Constance R. 1/31/23 Features: Durability Solid Coaster Sactionals Coaster is a great little addition to the Sactionals set up and the coffee table piece. Very sturdy, holds a beverage or snack bowl. Even though you could probably have your beverage rest on the flatness of the arm rest/side, this addition makes everything classier. Sadly, I don't think there's anything else I need from LoveSac now. I guess changing the covers is next!
- Paul B. 9/13/22 Features: Style Hickory coaster Great addition to our couch. Great look and awesome quality. Don’t hesitate to buy.
- Juan R. 6/20/22 Features: Style Totally worth it A solid addition to your lovesac couch. Highly recommend.
- Francesca D. 3/3/22 Love it We have one on each end of our couch and love them.
- Heather B. 2/12/21 Nice! Love the coasters - they fit perfectly on couch and keep your beverage right in reach.
- Mina G. 1/17/21 We love the versatility of the pieces. It literally anchors the whole space!
