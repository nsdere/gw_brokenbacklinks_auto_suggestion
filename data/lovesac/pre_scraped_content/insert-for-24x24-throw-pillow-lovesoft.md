Innards of a pillow
Not so much to say about the insides of a pillow. It’s there.

Very high quality
This is my second pillow. These are very high quality and are just perfect. Super soft, great for the sofa and the 24x24 is just the perfect size. So cozy

Sounds like a garbage bag inside the pillow
Very loud material when moving but stays fluffed up. I feel like I put a trash bag inside my pillows. It drives me crazy. So I’m not happy with the material used on the inserts but they are definitely keeping shape at the moment. I don’t know if I’ll keep using them or switch them out because the covers are great. These I don’t know if I can get past the loud material.
