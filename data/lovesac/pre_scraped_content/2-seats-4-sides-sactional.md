I love it but it is to pricey!
I understand it is quality but a layaway plan would be good!

Overall would buy again
I wanted to wait a little bit to write this review to make it as accurate as possible. We purchased a 5 seat, 7 side (one deep side) combo (standard seat cushions) and have been using it in multiple configurations. I have a long review, but I'll give the short version. Yes, I recommend this company. I have had great results when talking with customer service. Get into a show room if you can! But the phone/Facebook messaging customer service is also excellent. It shipped next day (forget the fact fedex lost it, it was still here [including storage seat] in two weeks). The fabric holds up well and doesn't show dirt (though does collect long dog hair, I recommend a ChomChom to fix that from Amazon, 100% worth it!). Overall, the competitors (other modular sectional brands) don't compete and the high price tag is worth it. Shipping was a bit of a nightmare, but eventually it worked out and Lovesac had excellent customer service throughout it. The fabric is beautiful, though the cushions do end up looking imperfect due to the fact they aren't stitched to the back of the couch. If you have dogs or kids on the couch frequently and having to adjust pillows a couple times a day is going to drive you crazy, this might not be for you. But for me, the benefits go way beyond that one negative (and that negative has a huge reason behind it, if they didn't move you couldn't wash them). Assembly is a little tough, so if you find yourself to be a bit weak I'd pay for assembly. Moving them around the first couple times is tough but once the spots for attachments loosen up a bit it's super easy. I will also say that deep seating is much more comfortable, so plan for that. Adding pillows to the regular seating gets a bit tight, but on deep seating it's fine. The storage seat is also a little frustrating, trying to keep the cushion on straight. I'm not sure why.

Dis messed up
I bought this couch and it had a dead cat inside of it. I want my money back, but will keep my new friend.

No regrets!
Purchased a year ago now and don't have a single regrets. I was buying a new couch almost yearly because I would change my mind on style, configurations, etc. so, we finally decided to invest that money into a Sactional and I would totally do it again! I've reconfigured so many times and love that the covers are washable. I have the taupe padded velvet and they wash great and look brand new after. They also hold up well with 4 dogs and 2 toddlers!

No Buyers Remorse with this Purchase
Set up: 5x5 five seats, five sides) Cover: grey corded velvet The couch is fantastic. I can't speak highly enough about it. We used to have a huge, oddly shaped couch that was awful to move and had little support. We recieved our sactional in the mail a few days early, which was great, but unexpected. I can't blame lovesac for the lack of communication in delivery because I signed up for updates through FedEx and it came through some rental truck. Everything was perfect and intact, just 3 days early with no heads up, can't really complain. Anyways, the couch is comfy. Little smell when unboxing, but not terrible. I'd say I'm mildly agitated by smell, and it didn't bother me. Set up is easy, and if you read the instructions and watch the online tutorial it makes it a breeze. I only watched part, but the whole ""don't clamp till the end"" was the biggest tip. The couch itself is really comfortable with the standard foam. I like the support it gives, but their alternatives are nice as well. The down was really soft, but had support. The lovesoft was nice as well. We just liked the support that came with the standard foam. We moved a building over shortly after receiving and it wasn't terrible. Lots of back and forth trips, but way easier than a single piece couch. Rearranging is just hard enough that you won't want to do it all the time, but easy enough to do when you really need it. I don't regret this purchase at all. Perfect couch.

Walnut Street location in Philadelphia is the best
I just wanna say that the walnut st location in philly has the best customer service ever :smiley:everyone there is so nice & helpful shout out to them :grin:

Fantastic and versatile
We were looking and took our time. We went and seen these at the Costco roadshow but ended up getting exactly what we wanted at the Nashville store. Chandler there was a Huge help. We bought the 8 seats and 10 sides as well as some extras. We ordered the CubPhur and oh how great it is. We have a large family of 6 and this sactional is perfect! I've had 8 back surgeries and the ability for a short or long seat is amazing for me. The sheer comfort is wonderful for my back too! We basically get 2 covers and endless designs. I would highly recommend this couch to anyone! We love our owl phur lovesac as well!

Bunny Approved!
We have been lovesac fans for years and recently purchased this couch to add to our collection. We are not disappointed, and often the couch is slept on more than the bed because it's so comfy. Our bunnies also love the couch and are often found napping on it. We also are happy with this system because if a cover ever gets destroyed by bunny teeth (so far no one has tested things out) we can replace it without buying a whole new couch or have to put up with a torn up cover. We love it!

Great for a house with Dogs
I love this couch. While It was a bit more than I wanted to spend, it is so so comfortable. We have already expanded it since purchasing to add an extra couple seats and sides. My favorite feature is the machine washable covers. We have three dogs in our house and I really wanted a light colored fabric couch. Leather scratches and is just not very comfortable. It is amazing being able to throw the covers in the wash. They clean up beautifully. I have the tan chenille covers and HIGHLY recommend them if you have pets that shed. The fur does not stick to it. And the lighter color works well since our pups have lighter colored fur. It is by far the most used peice of furniture in my house. The family lives on it. My one recommendation is to go with a deep configuration for the seats. It really makes the couch more comfortable. However, you have to get the different 'deep' sides if you have more than 2 deep in a row. For example, we have a 3x3 L shape with a total of two of the deep sides. One for the middle piece on each side.

So easy and versatile
I got my couch about a month ago and it is the best couch ever. I love that we can change it up and every single cover comes off. My dog has puked on it so I just popped the covers off and threw them in the wash. Good as new! We also had a problem with one of the seat covers so I emailed customer service and we got a new one right away. We will definitely be adding more pieces in the near future. I would recommend this to everyone!
