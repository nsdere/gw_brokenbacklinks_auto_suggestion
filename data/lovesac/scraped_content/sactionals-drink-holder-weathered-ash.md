- **Finsup** (Verified Buyer, 6/10/24): So my husband wanted these but we originally did not buy them. But after a few weeks I realized we really needed them. I bought 3, and I’m so glad I did. Wow. Has made all the difference. We don’t have a table in the living room, so there was not a place for drinks. These are so perfect. Super sturdy. Heavy. They do not move. Highly recommend.
  
- **Nell** (Verified Buyer, 4/16/24): Love them nice quality and heavy. They are made very well definitely worth the money.
  
- **Verified Buyer** (3/31/24): Solidly made! Fits on the arm of Lovesac couch snugly. The depth of holder helps keep glass from tipping over.
  
- **Verified Buyer** (3/27/24): We decided on the deeper drink holders. Perfect to keep things in place with the kids running around. To store, we just stick them on the back edge of the couch.
  
- **L A** (Verified Buyer, 3/3/24): We are thoroughly pleased with the purchase of our drink holder. It has been a great addition to our Lovesac sactional. The quality is wonderful, and the size is a perfect fit.
  
- **Carla G** (Verified Buyer, 2/14/24): Works great and fits multiple sizes of mugs and cups.
  
- **Naeface** (Verified Buyer, 1/20/24): Great product. Holds drinks well. Highly recommended.
  
- **Abby** (Verified Buyer, 8/18/23): I didn’t think I needed this, but now I am not sure how we went without! It is so convenient, and pretty too!
  
- **Laura O** (6/20/23): We love our new Lovesac! We bought our new couch about 6 months ago and we absolutely love it!
  
- **Brianna J.** (5/3/23): Matches perfectly with my couch and fits all my cups. Great addition rather than buying an end table.
