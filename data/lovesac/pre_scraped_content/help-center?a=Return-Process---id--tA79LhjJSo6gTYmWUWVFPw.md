Return Process

You can initiate a return with our Customer Love team or any of our Showrooms within 60-Days of delivery of any eligible item. Be sure to have your order information ready.

Once you have started a return you will need to get the items being returned packaged up in a similar fashion to the way they were delivered. This can be done in any packaging you have available. For some larger items (Seat Inserts, Side Insert, Sac Inserts) Lovesac can provide packaging upon request. We do not provide boxes for Covers or Accessories.

Covers need to be removed from Inserts and packaged separately to ensure the timely processing of your return. Please note that all Bigones will require a scheduled pick up with a 3rd party. Please ensure all accessories you are returning are given to the 3rd party upon pickup.

Once packaged and ready to ship, Lovesac provides pre-paid return shipping labels for you via email and can schedule a pickup for you as well. Please reach out if you are in need of a label.

Once the item has been received and verified, we will issue refunds back to the original form of payment within 10-14 business days.

If you paid in a Showroom with cash, refunds will be issued with a corporate check sent to the shipping address on file and may take an extended period of time.

We require all returns over $1,000 to be returned via FedEx Pickup. If items are dropped off at a FedEx shipping location, this will require additional time for locating, inspecting, and processing the return.
