This is our second one! Love the thickness and look of this blanket. The foot pocket is a convenient bonus!

Best blanket ever
This blanket is so warm and comfortable and the foot sac is the best invention!!! It actually has room for too smaller people! My daughter and I share it all the time! I couldn’t have asked for a better blanket!

So soft and warm! This was our second blanket and the foot pouch makes a huge difference in comfort and the blankets staying on you in really cold temps.

It only takes 307 of these bad boys to create a blanket aquarium
I bought 307 of these blankets to turn my apartment into a floating bed of comfort. Was the price crazy? Maybe? Am I Crazy? Well not anymore after coating every cubic foot of my apartment in Footsac Blanket: Wolf Phur. No matter where I stand, sleep, eat, shower I am in eternal comfort.

AMAZING
We bought this on a Wednesday and it came Friday with regular shipping, so we were blown away by that. The blankets softness is unmatched and we like how the pocket is divided so we can share it but still have our own space. Buy this!

No better blanket. The feet pocket is such a great feature. Makes you wonder why all blankets aren’t made like this. It’s a no brainer. Buy it.

The footsac is so well made. It is the warmest blanket I've ever owned. It is extremely soft and fluffy. The only issue I have is my dogs want to share it with me!
